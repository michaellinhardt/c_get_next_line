2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Seven!" I answered.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then, how do you know?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. "When I hear you give your reasons," I remarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Frequently."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"How often?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, some hundreds of times."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then how many are there?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"How many? I don't know."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this." He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. "It came by the last post," said he. "Read it aloud."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The note was undated, and without either signature or address.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do you imagine that it means?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do," I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. "Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Peculiar--that is the very word," said Holmes. "It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," and a large "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a customary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer." He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. "Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of you we have from all quarters received.' A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing out of the window. "A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I think that I had better go, Holmes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But your client--"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Come in!" said Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. "I told you that I would call." He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin," said he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I promise," said Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And I."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I was aware of it," said Holmes dryly.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I was also aware of that," murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case," he remarked, "I should be better able to advise you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. "You are right," he cried; "I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, "you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor," murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Precisely so. But how--"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Was there a secret marriage?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"None."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No legal papers or certificates?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"None."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There is the writing."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Pooh, pooh! Forgery."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My private note-paper."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Stolen."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My own seal."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Imitated."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My photograph."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Bought."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We were both in the photograph."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I was mad--insane."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You have compromised yourself seriously."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It must be recovered."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We have tried and failed."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"She will not sell."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Stolen, then."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No sign of it?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Absolutely none."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes laughed. "It is quite a pretty little problem," said he.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But a very serious one to me," returned the King reproachfully.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"To ruin me."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But how?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am about to be married."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"So I have heard."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And Irene Adler?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go--none."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am sure."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And why?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, then we have three days yet," said Holmes with a yawn. "That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then, as to money?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You have carte blanche."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Absolutely?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And for present expenses?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes," he said.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes took a note of it. "One other question," said he. "Was the photograph a cabinet?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It was."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson," he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. "If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:II.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What is it?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am following you closely," I answered.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he shouted, 'first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. 'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'What then?' I asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "and what then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,' she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Which are?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing the bell. "I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I shall be delighted."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You don't mind breaking the law?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Not in the least."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Nor running a chance of arrest?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Not in a good cause."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, the cause is excellent!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then I am your man."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I was sure that I might rely on you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But what is it you wish?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now," he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, "I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And what then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am to be neutral?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Entirely."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. "It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Precisely."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then you may entirely rely on me."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Where, indeed?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Where, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But it has twice been burgled."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Pshaw! They did not know how to look."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But how will you look?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I will not look."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I will get her to show me."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But she will refuse."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He is dead," cried several voices.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, no, there's life in him!" shouted another. "But he'll be gone before you can get him to hospital."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He's a brave fellow," said a woman. "They would have had the lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he's breathing now."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fire!" The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids--joined in a general shriek of "Fire!" Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You did it very nicely, Doctor," he remarked. "Nothing could have been better. It is all right."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You have the photograph?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I know where it is."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And how did you find out?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"She showed me, as I told you she would."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am still in the dark."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I guessed as much."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That also I could fathom."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"How did that help you?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And now?" I asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And when will you call?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I've heard that voice before," said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. "Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:III.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You have really got it!" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Not yet."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But you have hopes?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have hopes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We must have a cab."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, my brougham is waiting."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then that will simplify matters." We descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Married! When?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yesterday."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But to whom?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"To an English lawyer named Norton."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But she could not love him."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am in hopes that she does."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And why in hopes?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is true. And yet--! Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a queen she would have made!" He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. "Do you mean that she has left England?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Never to return."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And the papers?" asked the King hoarsely. "All is lost."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We shall see." He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to "Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for." My friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Very truly yours,              
2mo i, 1:"IRENE NORTON, nee ADLER."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's business to a more successful conclusion."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the King; "nothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly," said Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You have but to name it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"This photograph!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The King stared at him in amazement.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Irene's photograph!" he cried. "Certainly, if you wish it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good morning." He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:ADVENTURE  II.  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson," he said cordially.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I was afraid that you were engaged."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"So I am. Very much so."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then I can wait in the next room."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me," I observed.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. "Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?" he asked. "How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's carpenter."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, but China?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he. "I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it after all."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make a mistake in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, I have got it now," he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column. "Here it is. This is what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I took the paper from him and read as follows:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of $4 a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope's Court, Fleet Street."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What on earth does this mean?" I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. "It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?" said he. "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; "I have a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square, near the City. It's not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What is the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth, either. It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employe who comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among employers in this age. I don't know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson. "Never was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he's a good worker. There's no vice in him."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He is still with you, I presume?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean--that's all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Why that?' I asks.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn't know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?' he asked with his eyes open.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Never.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'And what are they worth?' I asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Tell me all about it,' said I.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Your experience has been a most entertaining one," remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting statement."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.' With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he as he released me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which would disgust you with human nature.' He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I answered that I had not.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"His face fell immediately.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Dear me!' he said gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'In the case of another,' said he, 'the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,' said I.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent Spaulding. 'I should be able to look after that for you.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'What would be the hours?' I asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Ten to two.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'That would suit me very well,' said I. 'And the pay?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Is $4 a week.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'And the work?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Is purely nominal.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'What do you call purely nominal?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,' said I.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross; 'neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'And the work?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Is to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. There is the first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Certainly,' I answered.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.' He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope's Court.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o'clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work. It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B's before very long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"To an end?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. It read in this fashion:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:IS
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:DISSOLVED.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:October 9, 1890.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. "If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. "I really wouldn't miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'What, the red-headed man?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Yes.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Where could I find him?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And what did you do then?" asked Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And you did very wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I have lost four pound a week."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"As far as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some $30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he been with you?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"About a month then."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"How did he come?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"In answer to an advertisement."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Was he the only applicant?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, I had a dozen."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Why did you pick him?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Because he was handy and would come cheap."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"At half wages, in fact."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I thought as much," said he. "Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is still with you?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And has your business been attended to in your absence?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do of a morning."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, Watson," said Holmes when our visitor had left us, "what do you make of it all?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I make nothing of it," I answered frankly. "It is a most mysterious business."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What are you going to do, then?" I asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"To smoke," he answered. "It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon," he remarked. "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with "JABEZ WILSON" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Third right, fourth left," answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Not him."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The knees of his trousers."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And what did you see?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What I expected to see."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Why did you beat the pavement?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, "I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor," he remarked as we emerged.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, it would be as well."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Why serious?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"At what time?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ten will be early enough."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I shall be at Baker Street at ten."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket." He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ha! Our party is complete," said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. "Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night's adventure."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see," said Jones in his consequential way. "Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase," observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir," said the police agent loftily. "He has his own little methods, which are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right," said the stranger with deference. "Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some $30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I've been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We are close there now," my friend remarked. "This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. "Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!" said Holmes severely. "You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We have at least an hour before us," he remarked, "for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is our French gold," whispered the director. "We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Your French gold?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Which were very well justified," observed Holmes. "And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And sit in the dark?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carree, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"They have but one retreat," whispered Holmes. "That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It's all clear," he whispered. "Have you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes blandly. "You have no chance at all."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"So I see," the other answered with the utmost coolness. "I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There are three men waiting for him at the door," said Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And I you," Holmes answered. "Your red-headed idea was very new and effective."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones. "He's quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands," remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. "You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and 'please.' "
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"All right," said Jones with a stare and a snigger. "Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That is better," said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay," said Holmes. "I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You see, Watson," he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, "it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the Encyclopaedia, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair. The $4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But how could you guess what the motive was?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar--something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?" I asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. "It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning. "Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And you are a benefactor of the race," said I.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use," he remarked. " 'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:ADVENTURE  III.  A CASE OF IDENTITY
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, "life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outre results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And yet I am not convinced of it," I answered. "The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect," remarked Holmes. "This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I smiled and shook my head. "I can quite understand your thinking so." I said. "Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here"--I picked up the morning paper from the ground--"let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his wife.' There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument," said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. "This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ah," said he, "I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And the ring?" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And have you any on hand just now?" I asked with interest.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have seen those symptoms before," said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. "Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Do you not find," he said, "that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I did at first," she answered, "but now I know where the letters are without looking." Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. "You've heard about me, Mr. Holmes," she cried, "else how could you know all that?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my business to know things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. "Yes, I did bang out of the house," she said, "for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank--that is, my father--took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Your father," said Holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since the name is different."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And your mother is alive?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got $4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't near as much as father could have got if he had been alive."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the business?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/4 per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about $60."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You have made your position very clear to me," said Holmes. "This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. "I met him first at the gasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father's friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, you know father didn't like anything of the sort. He wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street--and--"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What office?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don't know."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Where did he live, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He slept on the premises."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And you don't know his address?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No--except that it was Leadenhall Street."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Where did you address your letters, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It was most suggestive," said Holmes. "It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to France?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn't quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It missed him, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near King's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated," said Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"None."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"One more question. How did your mother take the matter?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And your father? Did you tell him?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night." She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I shall glance into the case for you," said Holmes, rising, "and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then you don't think I'll see him again?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I fear not."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then what has happened to him?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she. "Here is the slip and here are four letters from him."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Thank you. And your address?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your father's place of business?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Quite an interesting study, that maiden," he observed. "I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me," I remarked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It surprised me."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And what else?" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend's incisive reasoning.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I held the little printed slip to the light.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Missing," it said, "on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That will do," said Holmes. "As to the letters," he continued, glancing over them, "they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"They are typewritten," I remarked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive--in fact, we may call it conclusive."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Of what?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the denouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, have you solved it?" I asked as I entered.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, no, the mystery!" I cried.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o'clock?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"On the contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. "I am delighted to hear it," he said.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is a curious thing," remarked Holmes, "that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the 'e,' and a slight defect in the tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn," our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. "I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes," he said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. "I let you know, then, that I have caught him!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, it won't do--really it won't," said Holmes suavely. "There is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's right! Sit down and let us talk it over."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow. "It--it's not actionable," he stammered.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money," said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl's short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It was only a joke at first," groaned our visitor. "We never thought that she would have been so carried away."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl's affections from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes," said he, "but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The law cannot, as you say, touch you," said Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, "yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!" he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man's face, "it is not part of my duties to my client, but here's a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to--" He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. "That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning," I remarked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And how did you verify them?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employe, James Windibank. Voila tout!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And Miss Sutherland?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.' There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the 11:15."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What do you say, dear?" said my wife, looking across at me. "Will you go?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I really don't know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them," I answered. "But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only half an hour."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is really very good of you to come, Watson," said he. "It makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Have you heard anything of the case?" he asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That sounds a little paradoxical."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is a murder, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I could hardly imagine a more damning case," I remarked. "If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing," answered Holmes thoughtfully. "It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am afraid," said I, "that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact," he answered, laughing. "Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"How on earth--"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my metier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What are they?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner's jury."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It was a confession," I ejaculated.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"On the contrary," said Holmes, "it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I shook my head. "Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence," I remarked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What is the young man's own account of the matter?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may read it for yourself."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this way:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: 'I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of "Cooee!" which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The Coroner: What did you understand by that?
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Witness: I should prefer not to answer.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Witness: I must still refuse.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The Coroner: I understand that the cry of 'Cooee' was a common signal between you and your father?
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Witness: It was.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Witness: Nothing definite.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The Coroner: What do you mean?
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Yes, it was gone.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'You cannot say what it was?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'No, I had a feeling something was there.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'How far from the body?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'A dozen yards or so.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'And how far from the edge of the wood?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'About the same.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Yes, but with my back towards it.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"This concluded the examination of the witness."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I see," said I as I glanced down the column, "that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father's dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. "Both you and the coroner have been at some pains," said he, "to single out the very strongest points in the young man's favour. Don't you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outre as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have ordered a carriage," said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. "I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It was very nice and complimentary of you," Holmes answered. "It is entirely a question of barometric pressure."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Lestrade looked startled. "I do not quite follow," he said.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Lestrade laughed indulgently. "You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers," he said. "The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn't do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner," said Sherlock Holmes. "You may rely upon my doing all that I can."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I think that it is very probable."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There, now!" she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. "You hear! He gives me hopes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions," he said.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"In what way?" asked Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and--and--well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And your father?" asked Holmes. "Was he in favour of such a union?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it." A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Thank you for this information," said he. "May I see your father if I call to-morrow?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am afraid the doctor won't allow it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The doctor?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ha! In Victoria! That is important."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, at the mines."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, certainly."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I will, Miss Turner."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking." She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am ashamed of you, Holmes," said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes' silence. "Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy," said Holmes. "Have you an order to see him in prison?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, but only for you and me."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ample."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy's innocence.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The glass still keeps very high," he remarked as he sat down. "It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And what did you learn from him?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Nothing."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Could he throw no light?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I cannot admire his taste," I remarked, "if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But if he is innocent, who has done it?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry 'Cooee!' before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There is serious news this morning," Lestrade observed. "It is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"An elderly man, I presume?" said Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy's, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Indeed! That is interesting," said Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner's daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something from that?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We have got to the deductions and the inferences," said Lestrade, winking at me. "I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You are right," said Holmes demurely; "you do find it very hard to tackle the facts."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of," replied Lestrade with some warmth.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And that is--"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog," said Holmes, laughing. "But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, that is it." It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes' request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son's, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner's dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What did you go into the pool for?" he asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other trace. But how on earth--"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same feet." He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. "These are young McCarthy's feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father's feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?" He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It has been a case of considerable interest," he remarked, returning to his natural manner. "I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"This may interest you, Lestrade," he remarked, holding it out. "The murder was done with it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I see no marks."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There are none."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"How do you know, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And the murderer?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Lestrade laughed. "I am afraid that I am still a sceptic," he said. "Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Nous verrons," answered Holmes calmly. "You work your own method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably return to London by the evening train."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And leave your case unfinished?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, finished."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But the mystery?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is solved."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Who was the criminal, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The gentleman I describe."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But who is he?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a populous neighbourhood."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am a practical man," he said, "and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"All right," said Holmes quietly. "I have given you the chance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Look here, Watson," he said when the cloth was cleared "just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don't know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me expound."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Pray do so."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young McCarthy's narrative which struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that his father should, according to his account, cry 'Cooee!' before seeing him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son's ear. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What of this 'Cooee!' then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot. The 'Cooee!' was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But 'Cooee' is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What of the rat, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table. "This is a map of the Colony of Victoria," he said. "I wired to Bristol for it last night." He put his hand over part of the map. "What do you read?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"ARAT," I read.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And now?" He raised his hand.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"BALLARAT."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is wonderful!" I exclaimed.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which, granting the son's statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Certainly."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly wander."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Quite so."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But how did you gain them?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, they were peculiar boots."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But his lameness?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped--he was lame."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But his left-handedness."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son. He had even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are rolled in Rotterdam."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And the cigar-holder?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Holmes," I said, "you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in which all this points. The culprit is--"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Mr. John Turner," cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Pray sit down on the sofa," said Holmes gently. "You had my note?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And why did you wish to see me?" He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes," said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. "It is so. I know all about McCarthy."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The old man sank his face in his hands. "God help me!" he cried. "But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am glad to hear you say so," said Holmes gravely.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It may not come to that," said Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must be got off, however."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am a dying man," said old Turner. "I have had diabetes for years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him. "Just tell us the truth," he said. "I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It's as well," said the old man; "it's a question whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You didn't know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I'll tell you first how I came to be in his power.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It was in the early '60's at the diggings. I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Here we are, Jack,' says he, touching me on the arm; 'we'll be as good as a family to you. There's two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. If you don't--it's a fine, law-abiding country is England, and there's always a policeman within hail.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, it is not for me to judge you," said Holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out. "I pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Farewell, then," said the old man solemnly. "Your own deathbeds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine." Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"God help us!" said Holmes after a long silence. "Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as this that I do not think of Baxter's words, and say, 'There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.' "
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past.

2mo i, 1:ADVENTURE  V.  THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The year '87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque Sophy Anderson, of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man's watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell's fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother's, and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker Street.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Why," said I, glancing up at my companion, "that was surely the bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Except yourself I have none," he answered. "I do not encourage visitors."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"A client, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady's."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Come in!" said he.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I owe you an apology," he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes. "I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Give me your coat and umbrella," said Holmes. "They may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the south-west, I see."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, from Horsham."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have come for advice."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That is easily got."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And help."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That is not always so easy."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He said that you could solve anything."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He said too much."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That you are never beaten."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a woman."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But what is that compared with the number of your successes?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is true that I have been generally successful."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then you may be so with me."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is no ordinary one."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You fill me with interest," said Holmes. "Pray give us the essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My name," said he, "is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson's army, and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy's curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"One day--it was in March, 1883--a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel's plate. It was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. 'From India!' said he as he took it up, 'Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?' Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, 'K. K. K.!' he shrieked, and then, 'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'What is it, uncle?' I cried.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Death,' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'They may do what they like, but I'll checkmate them still,' said he with an oath. 'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'I wish you, John,' said my uncle, 'to witness my will. I leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can't say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of 'suicide.' But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some $14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"One moment," Holmes interposed, "your statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later, upon the night of May 2nd."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Thank you. Pray proceed."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and 'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' written beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, it was the beginning of '84 when my father came to live at Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of '85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?' he stammered.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My heart had turned to lead. 'It is K. K. K.,' said I.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He looked inside the envelope. 'So it is,' he cried. 'Here are the very letters. But what is this written above them?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Put the papers on the sundial,' I read, peeping over his shoulder.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'What papers? What sundial?' he asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'The sundial in the garden. There is no other,' said I; 'but the papers must be those that are destroyed.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Pooh!' said he, gripping hard at his courage. 'We are in a civilised land here, and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thing come from?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'From Dundee,' I answered, glancing at the postmark.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Some preposterous practical joke,' said he. 'What have I to do with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'I should certainly speak to the police,' I said.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Then let me do so?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'No, I forbid you. I won't have a fuss made about such nonsense.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of 'death from accidental causes.' Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle's life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It was in January, '85, that my poor father met his end, and two years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"This is the envelope," he continued. "The postmark is London--eastern division. Within are the very words which were upon my father's last message: 'K. K. K.'; and then 'Put the papers on the sundial.' "
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What have you done?" asked Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Nothing."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Nothing?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"To tell the truth"--he sank his face into his thin, white hands--"I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Tut! tut!" cried Sherlock Holmes. "You must act, man, or you are lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have seen the police."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ah!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. "Incredible imbecility!" he cried.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Has he come with you to-night?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No. His orders were to stay in the house."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Again Holmes raved in the air.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Why did you come to me," he cried, "and, above all, why did you not come at once?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have placed before us--no suggestive detail which might help us?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There is one thing," said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. "I have some remembrance," said he, "that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle's."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed, "March, 1869," and beneath were the following enigmatical notices:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:        John Swain, of St. Augustine.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"9th. McCauley cleared.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"10th. John Swain cleared.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"12th. Visited Paramore. All well."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Thank you!" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor. "And now you must on no account lose another instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get home instantly and act."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What shall I do?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Entirely."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I thank you," said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat. "You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you advise."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"By train from Waterloo."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am armed."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I shall see you at Horsham, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular." He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements--blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale--and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I think, Watson," he remarked at last, "that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But have you," I asked, "formed any definite conception as to what these perils are?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There can be no question as to their nature," he answered.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this unhappy family?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. "The ideal reasoner," he remarked, "would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes," I answered, laughing. "It was a singular document. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes grinned at the last item. "Well," he said, "I say now, as I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American Encyclopaedia which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third from London."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"From East London. What do you deduce from that?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest anything?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"A greater distance to travel."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But the letter had also a greater distance to come."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then I do not see the point."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is possible."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Good God!" I cried. "What can it mean, this relentless persecution?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner's jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But of what society?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Have you never--" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice--"have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I never have."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. "Here it is," said he presently:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government and of the better classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You will observe," said Holmes, laying down the volume, "that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then the page we have seen--"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, 'sent the pips to A, B, and C'--that is, sent the society's warning to them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You will excuse me for not waiting for you," said he; "I have, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw's."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What steps will you take?" I asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may have to go down to Horsham, after all."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You will not go there first?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Holmes," I cried, "you are too late."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ah!" said he, laying down his cup, "I feared as much. How was it done?" He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading 'Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.' Here is the account:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages.' "
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That hurts my pride, Watson," he said at last. "It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death--!" He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"They must be cunning devils," he exclaimed at last. "How could they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"To the police?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take the flies, but not before."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o'clock before he entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You are hungry," I remarked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since breakfast."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Nothing?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Not a bite. I had no time to think of it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And how have you succeeded?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You have a clue?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What do you mean?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote "S. H. for J. O." Then he sealed it and addressed it to "Captain James Calhoun, Barque Lone Star, Savannah, Georgia."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That will await him when he enters port," said he, chuckling. "It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And who is this Captain Calhoun?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"How did you trace it, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have spent the whole day," said he, "over Lloyd's registers and files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in '83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months. Of these, one, the Lone Star, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the Union."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Texas, I think."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an American origin."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque Lone Star was there in January, '85, my suspicion became a certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The Lone Star had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What will you do, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for news of the Lone Star of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters "L. S." carved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the Lone Star.

2mo i, 1:ADVENTURE  VI.  THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theological College of St. George's, was much addicted to opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De Quincey's description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:One night--it was in June, '89--there came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"A patient!" said she. "You'll have to go out."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You will excuse my calling so late," she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife's neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. "Oh, I'm in such trouble!" she cried; "I do so want a little help."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Why," said my wife, pulling up her veil, "it is Kate Whitney. How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I didn't know what to do, so I came straight to you." That was always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a light-house.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, no, no! I want the doctor's advice and help, too. It's about Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband's trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney's medical adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Thank you. I have not come to stay," said I. "There is a friend of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My God! It's Watson," said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. "I say, Watson, what o'clock is it?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Nearly eleven."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Of what day?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Of Friday, June 19th."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d'you want to frighten a chap for?" He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"So I am. But you've got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes--I forget how many. But I'll go home with you. I wouldn't frighten Kate--poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have you a cab?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, I have one waiting."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, "Walk past me, and then look back at me." The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Holmes!" I whispered, "what on earth are you doing in this den?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"As low as you can," he answered; "I have excellent ears. If you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have a cab outside."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes' requests, for they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney's bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I suppose, Watson," said he, "that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I was certainly surprised to find you there."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But not more so than I to find you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I came to find a friend."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And I to find an enemy."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"An enemy?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour's purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul's Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What! You do not mean bodies?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had $1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here." He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly--a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses' hoofs.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Now, Watson," said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns. "You'll come with me, won't you?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"If I can be of use."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The Cedars?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair's house. I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Where is it, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But I am all in the dark."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Of course you are. You'll know all about it presently. Jump up here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here's half a crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You have a grand gift of silence, Watson," said he. "It makes you quite invaluable as a companion. 'Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You forget that I know nothing about it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon. There's plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can't get the end of it into my hand. Now, I'll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Proceed, then."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Some years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to $88 10s., while he has $220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company's office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me so far?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is very clear."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps--for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night--and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell a cascade of children's bricks. It was the toy which he had promised to bring home.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--all were there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair's story, he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband's appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman's clothes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But a cripple!" said I. "What could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Pray continue your narrative."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which could incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair's assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair's coat, and not Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think they found in the pockets?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I cannot imagine."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, I don't think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies--421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat's sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It certainly sounds feasible."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved--what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We are on the outskirts of Lee," said my companion. "We have touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse's feet."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?" I asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well?" she cried, "well?" And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No good news?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"None."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No bad?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a long day."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am delighted to see you," said she, pressing my hand warmly. "You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My dear madam," said I, "I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, "I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Certainly, madam."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Upon what point?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. "Frankly, now!" she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Frankly, then, madam, I do not."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You think that he is dead?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I do."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Murdered?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I don't say that. Perhaps."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And on what day did he meet his death?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"On Monday."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter from him to-day."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What!" he roared.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, to-day." She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"May I see it?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Certainly."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Coarse writing," murmured Holmes. "Surely this is not your husband's writing, madam."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, but the enclosure is."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"How can you tell that?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha! there has been an enclosure here!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And you are sure that this is your husband's hand?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"One of his hands."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"One?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing, and yet I know it well."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in patience.--NEVILLE.' Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband's hand, madam?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"None. Neville wrote those words."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is over."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only posted to-day."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That is possible."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"If so, much may have happened between."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Very much so."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Was the window open?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then he might have called to you?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He might."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"A call for help, you thought?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes. He waved his hands."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is possible."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And you thought he was pulled back?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He disappeared so suddenly."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Never."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Never."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Awake, Watson?" he asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Game for a morning drive?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Certainly."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out." He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I want to test a little theory of mine," said he, pulling on his boots. "I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And where is it?" I asked, smiling.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"In the bathroom," he answered. "Oh, yes, I am not joking," he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. "I have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It has been in some points a singular case," said Holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop. "I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the horse's head while the other led us in.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Who is on duty?" asked Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Inspector Bradstreet, sir."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?" A tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. "I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet." "Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here." It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I called about that beggarman, Boone--the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"So I heard. You have him here?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"In the cells."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Is he quiet?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Dirty?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker's. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I should like to see him very much."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, I think that I'll take it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Very good. Come this way, if you please." He led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The third on the right is his," said the inspector. "Here it is!" He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He is asleep," said he. "You can see him very well."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He's a beauty, isn't he?" said the inspector.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He certainly needs a wash," remarked Holmes. "I had an idea that he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me." He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He! he! You are a funny one," chuckled the inspector.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, I don't know why not," said the inspector. "He doesn't look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?" He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner's face.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Let me introduce you," he shouted, "to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man's face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Great heavens!" cried the inspector, "it is, indeed, the missing man. I know him from the photograph."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. "Be it so," said he. "And pray what am I charged with?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"With making away with Mr. Neville St.-- Oh, come, you can't be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it," said the inspector with a grin. "Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No crime, but a very great error has been committed," said Holmes. "You would have done better to have trusted you wife."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It was not the wife; it was the children," groaned the prisoner. "God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an exposure! What can I do?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up," said he, "of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"God bless you!" cried the prisoner passionately. "I would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26s. 4d.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for $25. I was at my wit's end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight's grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at $2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn $700 a year--which is less than my average takings--but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take $2.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She little knew what.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife's eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That note only reached her yesterday," said Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Good God! What a week she must have spent!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The police have watched this Lascar," said Inspector Bradstreet, "and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no doubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Many times; but what was a fine to me?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It must stop here, however," said Bradstreet. "If the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I reached this one," said my friend, "by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:VII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You are engaged," said I; "perhaps I interrupt you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one"--he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat--"but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals. "I suppose," I remarked, "that, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it--that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, no. No crime," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of such."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"So much so," I remarked, "that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is to him that this trophy belongs."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is his hat."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson's fire. The facts are these: about four o'clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man's hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Which surely he restored to their owner?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that 'For Mrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird's left leg, and it is also true that the initials 'H. B.' are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What, then, did Peterson do?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Did he not advertise?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Only as much as we can deduce."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"From his hat?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Precisely."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker's name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials "H. B." were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I can see nothing," said I, handing it back to my friend.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. "It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been," he remarked, "and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My dear Holmes!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect," he continued, disregarding my remonstrance. "He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You are certainly joking, Holmes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. "It is a question of cubic capacity," said he; "a man with so large a brain must have something in it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The decline of his fortunes, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes laughed. "Here is the foresight," said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. "They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Your reasoning is certainly plausible."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's affection."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But he might be a bachelor."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird's leg."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, it is very ingenious," said I, laughing; "but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!" he gasped.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?" Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!" He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. "By Jove, Peterson!" said he, "this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were putty."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It's more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle!" I ejaculated.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of $1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!" The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan," I remarked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady's jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe." He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder's cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Hum! So much for the police-court," said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper. "The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What will you say?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: 'Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.' That is clear and concise."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Very. But will he see it?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"In which, sir?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James's, Evening News, Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Very well, sir. And this stone?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. "It's a bonny thing," said he. "Just see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil's pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? I'll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I cannot tell."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the matter?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And you can do nothing until then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Nothing."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes' room.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Mr. Henry Baker, I believe," said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. "Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes' surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We have retained these things for some days," said Holmes, "because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. "Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were," he remarked. "I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"To eat it!" Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, certainly, certainly," answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish--"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The man burst into a hearty laugh. "They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure," said he, "but beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There is your hat, then, and there your bird," said he. "By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Certainly, sir," said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. "There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum--we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity." With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"So much for Mr. Henry Baker," said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him. "It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Not particularly."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"By all means."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors' quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese," said he.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My geese!" The man seemed surprised.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose club."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them's not our geese."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Indeed! Whose, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Breckinridge is his name."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ah! I don't know him. Well, here's your good health landlord, and prosperity to your house. Good-night."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Now for Mr. Breckinridge," he continued, buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air. "Remember, Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years' penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick march!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Good-evening. It's a cold night," said Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Sold out of geese, I see," continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That's no good."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ah, but I was recommended to you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Who by?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The landlord of the Alpha."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Now, then, mister," said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, "what are you driving at? Let's have it straight, now."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well then, I shan't tell you. So now!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don't know why you should be so warm over such a trifle."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Warm! You'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it's 'Where are the geese?' and 'Who did you sell the geese to?' and 'What will you take for the geese?' One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries," said Holmes carelessly. "If you won't tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I'm always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, then, you've lost your fiver, for it's town bred," snapped the salesman.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It's nothing of the kind."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I say it is."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I don't believe it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"D'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You'll never persuade me to believe that."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Will you bet, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It's merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I'll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The salesman chuckled grimly. "Bring me the books, Bill," said he.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Now then, Mr. Cocksure," said the salesman, "I thought that I was out of geese, but before I finish you'll find that there is still one left in my shop. You see this little book?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That's the list of the folk from whom I buy. D'you see? Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road--249," read Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes turned to the page indicated. "Here you are, 'Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.' "
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Now, then, what's the last entry?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.' "
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Quite so. There you are. And underneath?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.' "
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What have you to say now?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the 'Pink 'un' protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet," said he. "I daresay that if I had put $100 down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should--"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I've had enough of you and your geese," he shouted. "I wish you were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I'll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I'll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No; but one of them was mine all the same," whined the little man.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"She told me to ask you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I've had enough of it. Get out of this!" He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road," whispered Holmes. "Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow." Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Who are you, then? What do you want?" he asked in a quavering voice.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You will excuse me," said Holmes blandly, "but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think that I could be of assistance to you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don't know."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But you can know nothing of this?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet," cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. "I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. "In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place," said he. "But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The man hesitated for an instant. "My name is John Robinson," he answered with a sidelong glance.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, no; the real name," said Holmes sweetly. "It is always awkward doing business with an alias."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. "Well then," said he, "my real name is James Ryder."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Here we are!" said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. "The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became of those geese?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, sir."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested--white, with a black bar across the tail."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Ryder quivered with emotion. "Oh, sir," he cried, "can you tell me where it went to?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It came here."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Here?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don't wonder that you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here in my museum."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The game's up, Ryder," said Holmes quietly. "Hold up, man, or you'll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He's not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar's?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it," said he in a crackling voice.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I see--her ladyship's waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady's room--you and your confederate Cusack--and you managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then--"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion's knees. "For God's sake, have mercy!" he shrieked. "Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I'll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don't bring it into court! For Christ's sake, don't!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Get back into your chair!" said Holmes sternly. "It is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against him will break down."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. "I will tell you it just as it happened, sir," said he. "When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister's house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds--a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?' says she.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Well,' said I, 'you said you'd give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you--Jem's bird, we call it. It's the big white one over yonder. There's twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is all the same to you, I'd rather have that one I was handling just now.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'The other is a good three pound heavier,' said she, 'and we fattened it expressly for you.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Never mind. I'll have the other, and I'll take it now,' said I.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Oh, just as you like,' said she, a little huffed. 'Which is it you want, then?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister's, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Where are they all, Maggie?' I cried.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Gone to the dealer's, Jem.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Which dealer's?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'But was there another with a barred tail?' I asked, 'the same as the one I chose?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now--and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!" He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes' finger-tips upon the edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Get out!" said he.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No more words. Get out!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"After all, Watson," said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, "I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief feature."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:VIII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was early in April in the year '83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson," said he, "but it's the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What is it, then--a fire?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Good-morning, madam," said Holmes cheerily. "My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is not cold which makes me shiver," said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror." She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You must not fear," said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. "We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You know me, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There is no mystery, my dear madam," said he, smiling. "The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct," said she. "I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Farintosh," said he. "Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Alas!" replied our visitor, "the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am all attention, madam."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes nodded his head. "The name is familiar to me," said he.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother's re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money--not less than $1000 a year--and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather's case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Your sister is dead, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Pray be precise as to details," said he.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Perfectly so."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Tell me, Helen,' said she, 'have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Never,' said I.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Certainly not. But why?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.' She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Indeed," said Holmes. "Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Always."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And why?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my sister's voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister's door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, 'Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!' There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown. When he reached my sister's side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"One moment," said Holmes, "are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? Could you swear to it?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Was your sister dressed?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come to?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott's conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"How about poison?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The doctors examined her for it, but without success."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, there are nearly always some there."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a speckled band?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"These are very deep waters," said he; "pray go on with your narrative."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You have done wisely," said my friend. "But have you told me all?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, all."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Why, what do you mean?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You have been cruelly used," said Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. "He is a hard man," she said, "and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"This is a very deep business," he said at last. "There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"By no means."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon." She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And what do you think of it all, Watson?" asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Dark enough and sinister enough."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I cannot think."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But what, then, did the gipsies do?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I cannot imagine."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I see many objections to any such theory."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Which of you is Holmes?" asked this apparition.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me," said my companion quietly.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Indeed, Doctor," said Holmes blandly. "Pray take a seat."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her. What has she been saying to you?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is a little cold for the time of the year," said Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What has she been saying to you?" screamed the old man furiously.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But I have heard that the crocuses promise well," continued my companion imperturbably.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ha! You put me off, do you?" said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop. "I know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:My friend smiled.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Holmes, the busybody!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:His smile broadened.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes chuckled heartily. "Your conversation is most entertaining," said he. "When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I will go when I have said my say. Don't you dare to meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here." He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"See that you keep yourself out of my grip," he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He seems a very amiable person," said Holmes, laughing. "I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own." As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was nearly one o'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have seen the will of the deceased wife," said he. "To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the time of the wife's death was little short of $1100, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than $750. Each daughter can claim an income of $250, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent. My morning's work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley's No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Look there!" said he.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Stoke Moran?" said he.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott," remarked the driver.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There is some building going on there," said Holmes; "that is where we are going."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There's the village," said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; "but if you want to get to the house, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner," observed Holmes, shading his eyes. "Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I thought it as well," said Holmes as we climbed the stile, "that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as our word."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. "I have been waiting so eagerly for you," she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. "All has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance," said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Good heavens!" she cried, "he has followed me, then."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"So it appears."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he say when he returns?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt's at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister's, and the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott's chamber?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of course?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. "Hum!" said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, "my theory certainly presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Where does that bell communicate with?" he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It goes to the housekeeper's room."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It looks newer than the other things?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Your sister asked for it, I suppose?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor." He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Why, it's a dummy," said he.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Won't it ring?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"How very absurd! I never noticed that before."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Very strange!" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. "There are one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That is also quite modern," said the lady.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Done about the same time as the bell-rope?" remarked Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Dr. Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What's in here?" he asked, tapping the safe.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My stepfather's business papers."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh! you have seen inside, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There isn't a cat in it, for example?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No. What a strange idea!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, look at this!" He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No; we don't keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine." He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Thank you. That is quite settled," said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket. "Hullo! Here is something interesting!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What do you make of that, Watson?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It's a common enough lash. But I don't know why it should be tied."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it's a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is very essential, Miss Stoner," said he, "that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I shall most certainly do so."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend upon your compliance."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I assure you that I am in your hands."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village inn over there?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, that is the Crown."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Certainly."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, yes, easily."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The rest you will leave in our hands."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But what will you do?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind," said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Perhaps I have."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then, for pity's sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister's death."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Do you know, Watson," said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness, "I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a distinct element of danger."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Can I be of assistance?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Your presence might be invaluable."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then I shall certainly come."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is very kind of you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that you saw all that I did."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You saw the ventilator, too?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My dear Holmes!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry. I deduced a ventilator."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But what harm can there be in that?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that strike you?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I cannot as yet see any connection."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I cannot say that I have."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Holmes," I cried, "I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness' sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That is our signal," said Holmes, springing to his feet; "it comes from the middle window."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My God!" I whispered; "did you see it?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is a nice household," he murmured. "That is the baboon."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes' example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The least sound would be fatal to our plans."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I nodded to show that I had heard.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I nodded again.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You see it, Watson?" he yelled. "You see it?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What can it mean?" I gasped.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It means that it is all over," Holmes answered. "And perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott's room."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The band! the speckled band!" whispered Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is a swamp adder!" cried Holmes; "the deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm's length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I had," said he, "come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word 'band,' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"With the result of driving it through the ventilator."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott's death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:IX.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB
2mo i, 1:

2mo i, 1:Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice--that of Mr. Hatherley's thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton's madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was in the summer of '89, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:One morning, at a little before seven o'clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I've got him here," he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; "he's all right."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What is it, then?" I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It's a new patient," he whispered. "I thought I'd bring him round myself; then he couldn't slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you." And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor," said he, "but I have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I took it up and glanced at it. "Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor)." That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. "I regret that I have kept you waiting," said I, sitting down in my library-chair. "You are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, my night could not be called monotonous," said he, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Stop it!" I cried; "pull yourself together!" and I poured out some water from a caraffe.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and pale-looking.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have been making a fool of myself," he gasped.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Not at all. Drink this." I dashed some brandy into the water, and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That's better!" said he. "And now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Good heavens!" I cried, "this is a terrible injury. It must have bled considerably."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Excellent! You should have been a surgeon."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"This has been done," said I, examining the wound, "by a very heavy and sharp instrument."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"A thing like a cleaver," said he.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"An accident, I presume?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"By no means."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What! a murderous attack?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Very murderous indeed."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You horrify me."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"How is that?" I asked when I had finished.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying to your nerves."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ha!" cried I, "if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, I have heard of that fellow," answered my visitor, "and I should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to him?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I'll do better. I'll take you round to him myself."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I should be immensely obliged to you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We'll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an instant." I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr. Hatherley," said he. "Pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Thank you," said my patient. "but I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You must know," said he, "that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father's death, I determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to $27 10s. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Mr. Hatherley?' said he, with something of a German accent. 'You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address. 'May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'That is quite correct,' I answered; 'but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essential--absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'If I promise to keep a secret,' said I, 'you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Do you promise, then?' said he at last.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Yes, I promise.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'I have already given you my word.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Very good.' He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'That's all right,' said he, coming back. 'I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master's affairs. Now we can talk in safety.' He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'I beg that you will state your business, sir,' said I; 'my time is of value.' Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to my lips.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'How would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you?' he asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Most admirably.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'I say a night's work, but an hour's would be nearer the mark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Where to?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Very good.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'There is a drive, then?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to me. 'Not at all,' said I, 'I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Entirely.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that fuller's-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one or two places in England?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'I have heard so.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Some little time ago I bought a small place--a very small place--within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller's-earth in one of my fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left--both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'I quite follow you,' said I. 'The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller's-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Ah!' said he carelessly, 'we have our own process. We compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.' He rose as he spoke. 'I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'I shall certainly be there.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'And not a word to a soul.' He looked at me with a last long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his explanation of the fuller's-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock. I was the only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the horse could go."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"One horse?" interjected Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, only one."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Did you observe the colour?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage. It was a chestnut."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Tired-looking or fresh?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, fresh and glossy."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most interesting statement."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,' said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door. 'I shall not keep you waiting an instant,' said he, and vanished into the darkness.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'I would go,' said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; 'I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you to do.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'But, madam,' said I, 'I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'It is not worth your while to wait,' she went on. 'You can pass through the door; no one hinders.' And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. 'For the love of Heaven!' she whispered, 'get away from here before it is too late!'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'This is my secretary and manager,' said the colonel. 'By the way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear that you have felt the draught.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'On the contrary,' said I, 'I opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. 'Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,' said he. 'Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'I had better put my hat on, I suppose.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Oh, no, it is in the house.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'What, you dig fuller's-earth in the house?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'We are now,' said he, 'actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller's-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'What are you doing there?' he asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me. 'I was admiring your fuller's-earth,' said I; 'I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Very well,' said he, 'you shall know all about the machine.' He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. 'Hullo!' I yelled. 'Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Come! come!' she cried breathlessly. 'They will be here in a moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit's end. Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'It is your only chance,' said she. 'It is high, but it may be that you can jump it.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher's cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Fritz! Fritz!' she cried in English, 'remember your promise after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'You are mad, Elise!' he shouted, struggling to break away from her. 'You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!' He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night's adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles off.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Here is an advertisement which will interest you," said he. "It appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: 'Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o'clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was dressed in,' etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Good heavens!" cried my patient. "Then that explains what the girl said."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There you are," said he. "That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It was an hour's good drive."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What I cannot understand," said I, "is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my life."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, we shall soon clear up all that," said Bradstreet. "Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I think I could lay my finger on it," said Holmes quietly.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Really, now!" cried the inspector, "you have formed your opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the country is more deserted there."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And I say east," said my patient.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am for west," remarked the plain-clothes man. "There are several quiet little villages up there."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And I am for north," said I, "because there are no hills there, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Come," cried the inspector, laughing; "it's a very pretty diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your casting vote to?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You are all wrong."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But we can't all be."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, yes, you can. This is my point." He placed his finger in the centre of the circle. "This is where we shall find them."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But the twelve-mile drive?" gasped Hatherley.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough," observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. "Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"None at all," said Holmes. "They are coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work," said the inspector. "They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"A house on fire?" asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, sir!" said the station-master.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"When did it break out?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the whole place is in a blaze."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Whose house is it?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Dr. Becher's."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Tell me," broke in the engineer, "is Dr. Becher a German, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The station-master laughed heartily. "No, sir, Dr. Becher is an Englishman, and there isn't a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That's it!" cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. "There is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second window is the one that I jumped from."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, at least," said Holmes, "you have had your revenge upon them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:And Holmes' fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes' ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well," said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London, "it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Experience," said Holmes, laughing. "Indirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:X.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend's noble correspondent could be.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Here is a very fashionable epistle," I remarked as he entered. "Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety," he answered, smiling, "and the humbler are usually the more interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Not social, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, distinctly professional."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And from a noble client?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"One of the highest in England."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My dear fellow, I congratulate you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It looks like it," said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. "I have had nothing else to do."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, yes, with the deepest interest."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St. Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he says:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:--Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o'clock in the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. Yours faithfully,
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'ST. SIMON.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger," remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He says four o'clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is." He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. "Here he is," said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. " 'Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.' Hum! 'Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.' He's forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more solid."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have very little difficulty in finding what I want," said I, "for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van. That is quite cleared up now--though, indeed, it was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: 'A marriage has been arranged,' it says, 'and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.' That is all."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Terse and to the point," remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: 'There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god's arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.' "
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Anything else?" asked Holmes, yawning.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St. George's, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later--that is, on Wednesday last--there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater's place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Before the what?" asked Holmes with a start.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The vanishing of the lady."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"When did she vanish, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"At the wedding breakfast."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let me have the details."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I warn you that they are very incomplete."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Perhaps we may make them less so."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, 'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding':
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'The ceremony, which was performed at St. George's, Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride.' "
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And is that all?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And it is--"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now--so far as it has been set forth in the public press."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Lord Robert St. Simon," announced our page-boy, throwing open the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Good-day, Lord St. Simon," said Holmes, rising and bowing. "Pray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, I am descending."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I beg pardon."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My last client of the sort was a king."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The King of Scandinavia."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What! Had he lost his wife?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You can understand," said Holmes suavely, "that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Of course! Very right! very right! I'm sure I beg pardon. As to my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct--this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Lord St. Simon glanced over it. "Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Pray do so."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"In San Francisco, a year ago."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You were travelling in the States?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Did you become engaged then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But you were on a friendly footing?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Her father is very rich?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And how did he make his money?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady's--your wife's character?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. "You see, Mr. Holmes," said he, "my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear"--he gave a little stately cough--"had I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Have you her photograph?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I brought this with me." He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I really have made no inquiries on the subject."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Was she in good spirits?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"She was as bright as possible--at least until after the ceremony."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And did you observe any change in her then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Pray let us have it, for all that."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. There was a moment's delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the general public were present, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"This gentleman was not one of your wife's friends?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her father's house?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I saw her in conversation with her maid."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And who is her maid?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California with her."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"A confidential servant?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"How long did she speak to this Alice?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You did not overhear what they said?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Lady St. Simon said something about 'jumping a claim.' She was accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"She walked into the breakfast-room."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"On your arm?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride's dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house that morning."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. "We have been on a friendly footing for some years--I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran's door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Did your wife hear all this?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, thank goodness, she did not."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, it is a possible supposition."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You think so, too?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I do not think Flora would hurt a fly."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis," said Holmes, smiling. "And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We could see the other side of the road and the Park."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall communicate with you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem," said our client, rising.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have solved it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Eh? What was that?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I say that I have solved it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Where, then, is my wife?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That is a detail which I shall speedily supply."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Lord St. Simon shook his head. "I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine," he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My dear Holmes!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau's example."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But I have heard all that you have heard."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases--but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What's up, then?" asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. "You look dissatisfied."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Really! You surprise me."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And very wet it seems to have made you," said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"In heaven's name, what for?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"In search of the body of Lady St. Simon."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?" he asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Why? What do you mean?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. "I suppose you know all about it," he snarled.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I think it very unlikely."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?" He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. "There," said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. "There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, indeed!" said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. "You dragged them from the Serpentine?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"By the same brilliant reasoning, every man's body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am afraid that you will find it difficult."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Are you, indeed, now?" cried Lestrade with some bitterness. "I am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And how?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a note. And here is the very note." He slapped it down upon the table in front of him. "Listen to this: 'You will see me when all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.' Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Very good, Lestrade," said Holmes, laughing. "You really are very fine indeed. Let me see it." He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction. "This is indeed important," said he.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ha! you find it so?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. "Why," he shrieked, "you're looking at the wrong side!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"On the contrary, this is the right side."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The right side? You're mad! Here is the note written in pencil over here."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There's nothing in it. I looked at it before," said Lestrade. " 'Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.' I see nothing in that."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I've wasted time enough," said Lestrade, rising. "I believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first." He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Just one hint to you, Lestrade," drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; "I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such person."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat. "There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work," he remarked, "so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner's man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pate de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Just before nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"They have laid the supper, then," he said, rubbing his hands.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You seem to expect company. They have laid for five."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in," said he. "I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My messenger reached you, then?" asked Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you good authority for what you say?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The best possible."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What will the Duke say," he murmured, "when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any humiliation."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It was a slight, sir, a public slight," said Lord St. Simon, tapping his fingers upon the table.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I think that I heard a ring," said Holmes. "Yes, there are steps on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more successful." He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. "Lord St. Simon," said he "allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You're angry, Robert," said she. "Well, I guess you have every cause to be."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Pray make no apology to me," said Lord St. Simon bitterly.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn't know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn't fall down and do a faint right there before the altar."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"If I may give an opinion," remarked the strange gentleman, "we've had just a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it." He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then I'll tell our story right away," said the lady. "Frank here and I met in '84, in McQuire's camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn't hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to 'Frisco. Frank wouldn't throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. 'Why shouldn't we be married right away, then,' said he, 'and then I will feel sure of you; and I won't claim to be your husband until I come back?' Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank's name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in 'Frisco. Not a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to 'Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I'd have done my duty by him. We can't command our love, but we can our actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn't drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. I didn't know what to do. Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. I hadn't been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me--seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also--but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to 'Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I saw it in a paper," explained the American. "It gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again--just sending a line to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Excuse me," he said, "but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then you won't forgive me? You won't shake hands before I go?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure." He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I had hoped," suggested Holmes, "that you would have joined us in a friendly supper."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I think that there you ask a little too much," responded his Lordship. "I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night." He included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company," said Sherlock Holmes. "It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The case has been an interesting one," remarked Holmes when our visitors had left us, "because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You were not yourself at fault at all, then?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American. Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St. Simon's narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride's manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners' parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to--the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband--the chances being in favour of the latter."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And how in the world did you find them?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"How did you deduce the select?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But with no very good result," I remarked. "His conduct was certainly not very gracious."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ah, Watson," said Holmes, smiling, "perhaps you would not be very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:XI.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Holmes," said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street, "here is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What on earth can be the matter with him?" I asked. "He is looking up at the numbers of the houses."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I believe that he is coming here," said Holmes, rubbing his hands.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Here?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?" As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?" said he. "You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No doubt you think me mad?" said he.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I see that you have had some great trouble," responded Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"God knows I have!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Pray compose yourself, sir," said Holmes, "and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My name," answered our visitor, "is probably familiar to your ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I feel that time is of value," said he; "that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth--one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Mr. Holder,' said he, 'I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'The firm does so when the security is good.' I answered.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'It is absolutely essential to me,' said he, 'that I should have $50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one's self under obligations.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?' I asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,' said I, 'were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'I should much prefer to have it so,' said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. 'You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,' said I.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Precisely.' He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. 'There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,' said he, 'and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my security.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'You doubt its value?' he asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Not at all. I only doubt--'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Ample.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty $1000 notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers' safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes--a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman's quick insight into character.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house--sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late--forever too late!
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable story.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Where have you put it?' asked Arthur.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'In my own bureau.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Well, I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the night.' said he.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'It is locked up,' I answered.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Look here, dad,' said he with his eyes cast down, 'can you let me have $200?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'No, I cannot!' I answered sharply. 'I have been far too generous with you in money matters.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'You have been very kind,' said he, 'but I must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'And a very good thing, too!' I cried.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,' said he. 'I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. 'You shall not have a farthing from me,' I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure--a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Tell me, dad,' said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, 'did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Certainly not.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Quite sure, dad.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Then, good-night.' I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Arthur!' I screamed, 'you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'You blackguard!' I shouted, beside myself with rage. 'You have destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels which you have stolen?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Stolen!' he cried.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Yes, thief!' I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,' said he.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'You have called me names enough,' said he, 'I will not stand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'You shall leave it in the hands of the police!' I cried half-mad with grief and rage. 'I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'You shall learn nothing from me,' said he with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his nature. 'If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face, she read the whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in everything.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'At least,' said he, 'you will not have me arrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen,' said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'You may as well face the matter,' said I; 'you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' he answered, turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already offered a reward of $1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Do you receive much company?" he asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur's. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one else, I think."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Do you go out much in society?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That is unusual in a young girl."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is four-and-twenty."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Terrible! She is even more affected than I."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You have neither of you any doubt as to your son's guilt?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, it was twisted."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten it?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"They considered that it might be caused by Arthur's closing his bedroom door."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Have they thought of looking outside the house?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely examined."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Now, my dear sir," said Holmes. "is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But what other is there?" cried the banker with a gesture of despair. "If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is our task to find that out," replied Holmes; "so now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes' judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen's entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen's path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?" she asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman's instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I shall never let it drop until the gems are found--never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"This gentleman?" she asked, facing round to me.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable lane now."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The stable lane?" She raised her dark eyebrows. "What can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it," returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes. "I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You heard nothing yourself last night?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I came down."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the windows?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Were they all fastened this morning?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But what is the good of all these vague theories," cried the banker impatiently, "when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Do you know him?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He stood," said Holmes, "to the left of the door--that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, he did."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And he is a man with a wooden leg?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Something like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive black eyes. "Why, you are like a magician," said she. "How do you know that?" She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes' thin, eager face.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I should be very glad now to go upstairs," said he. "I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. "Now we shall go upstairs," said he at last.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Which key was used to open it?" he asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That which my son himself indicated--that of the cupboard of the lumber-room."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Have you it here?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That is it on the dressing-table."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is a noiseless lock," said he. "It is no wonder that it did not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a look at it." He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller's art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Now, Mr. Holder," said Holmes, "here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it off."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The banker recoiled in horror. "I should not dream of trying," said he.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then I will." Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. "I feel it give a little," said he; "but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss Holder?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I confess that I still share my uncle's perplexity."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder," said he; "I can serve you best by returning to my rooms."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I cannot tell."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The banker wrung his hands. "I shall never see them again!" he cried. "And my son? You give me hopes?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My opinion is in no way altered."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then, for God's sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I would give my fortune to have them back."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then. Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I think that this should do," said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace. "I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won't do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o'-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few hours." He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I only looked in as I passed," said he. "I am going right on."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Where to?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I get back. Don't wait up for me in case I should be late."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"How are you getting on?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson," said he, "but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Why, it is after nine now," I answered. "I should not be surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried," said he. "Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Deserted you?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'MY DEAREST UNCLE:--I feel that I have brought trouble upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'MARY.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to suicide?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned something! Where are the gems?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You would not think $1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I would pay ten."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for $4000."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You have it!" he gasped. "I am saved! I am saved!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder," said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Owe!" He caught up a pen. "Name the sum, and I will pay it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then it was not Arthur who took them?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"For heaven's sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My Mary? Impossible!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England--a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I cannot, and I will not, believe it!" cried the banker with an ashen face.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants' escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Is it possible?" gasped the banker.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet," cried Mr. Holder. "Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"When I arrived at the house," continued Holmes, "I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen's path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet?
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret--the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George's house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening," said Mr. Holder.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held--$1000 apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. 'Why, dash it all!' said he, 'I've let them go at six hundred for the three!' I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at $1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o'clock, after what I may call a really hard day's work."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"A day which has saved England from a great public scandal," said the banker, rising. "Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I think that we may safely say," returned Holmes, "that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:XII.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"To the man who loves art for its own sake," remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily Telegraph, "it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many causes celebres and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And yet," said I, smiling, "I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You have erred, perhaps," he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood--"you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter," I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend's singular character.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No, it is not selfishness or conceit," said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. "If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing--a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"At the same time," he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, "you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The end may have been so," I answered, "but the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial. I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!" He tossed a crumpled letter across to me.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"DEAR MR. HOLMES:--I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"VIOLET HUNTER."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Do you know the young lady?" I asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Not I."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is half-past ten now."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case, also."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover's egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure," said she, as my companion rose to greet her, "but I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have been a governess for five years," said she, "in the family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wit's end as to what I should do.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway's, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'That will do,' said he; 'I could not ask for anything better. Capital! capital!' He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'You are looking for a situation, miss?' he asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Yes, sir.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'As governess?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Yes, sir.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'And what salary do you ask?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'I had $4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Oh, tut, tut! sweating--rank sweating!' he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. 'How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,' said I. 'A little French, a little German, music, and drawing--'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Tut, tut!' he cried. 'This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at $100 a year.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'It is also my custom,' said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, 'to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'May I ask where you live, sir?' said I.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'One child--one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!' He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I was a little startled at the nature of the child's amusement, but the father's laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'My sole duties, then,' I asked, 'are to take charge of a single child?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,' he cried. 'Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'I should be happy to make myself useful.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you know--faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'No,' said I, considerably astonished at his words.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Oh, no.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'I am afraid that that is quite impossible,' said I. He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'I am afraid that it is quite essential,' said he. 'It is a little fancy of my wife's, and ladies' fancies, you know, madam, ladies' fancies must be consulted. And so you won't cut your hair?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'No, sir, I really could not,' I answered firmly.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?' she asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'If you please, Miss Stoper.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion,' said she sharply. 'You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.' She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table. I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting $100 a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read it to you:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'DEAR MISS HUNTER:--Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We are willing to give $30 a quarter, or $120 a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'JEPHRO RUCASTLE.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question," said Holmes, smiling.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But you would not advise me to refuse?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That is a possible solution--in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, yes, of course the pay is good--too good. That is what makes me uneasy. Why should they give you $120 a year, when they could have their pick for $40? There must be some strong reason behind."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger--"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Danger! What danger do you foresee?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes shook his head gravely. "It would cease to be a danger if we could define it," said he. "But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That is enough." She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. "I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow." With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"At least," said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, "she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And she would need to be," said Holmes gravely. "I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was not very long before my friend's prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. "Data! data! data!" he cried impatiently. "I can't make bricks without clay." And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Just look up the trains in Bradshaw," said he, and turned back to his chemical studies.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The summons was a brief and urgent one.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow," it said. "Do come! I am at my wit's end.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"HUNTER."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Will you come with me?" asked Holmes, glancing up.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I should wish to."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Just look it up, then."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There is a train at half-past nine," said I, glancing over my Bradshaw. "It is due at Winchester at 11:30."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:By eleven o'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man's energy. All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Are they not fresh and beautiful?" I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:But Holmes shook his head gravely.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Do you know, Watson," said he, "that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Good heavens!" I cried. "Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You horrify me!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard's blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Quite so. She has her freedom."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What can be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am so delighted that you have come," she said earnestly. "It is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Pray tell us what has happened to you."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Let us have everything in its due order." Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What can you not understand?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton's preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father's young wife.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am glad of all details," remarked my friend, "whether they seem to you to be relevant or not."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Oh, yes,' said he, turning to me, 'we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense repertoire, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Jephro,' said she, 'there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?' he asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'No, I know no one in these parts.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Surely it would be better to take no notice.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round and wave him away like that.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Pray continue," said Holmes. "Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Look in here!' said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks. 'Is he not a beauty?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Don't be frightened,' said my employer, laughing at the start which I had given. 'It's only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness' sake don't you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it's as much as your life is worth.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Ah!' said he, 'you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I assured him that I was not offended. 'By the way,' said I, 'you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Photography is one of my hobbies,' said he. 'I have made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?' He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty--a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman's instinct; perhaps it was woman's instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran--ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'So,' said he, smiling, 'it was you, then. I thought that it must be when I saw the door open.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Oh, I am so frightened!' I panted.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'My dear young lady! my dear young lady!'--you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was--'and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on my guard against him.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,' I answered. 'But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Only that?' said he, looking at me keenly.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Why, what did you think?' I asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Why do you think that I lock this door?'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'I am sure that I do not know.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?' He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'I am sure if I had known--'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:" 'Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again'--here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon--'I'll throw you to the mastiff.'
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o'clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Is Toller still drunk?" he asked.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with him."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, the wine-cellar."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I will try. What is it?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock, my friend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I will do it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers--possibly her fiance--and no doubt, as you wore the girl's dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"What on earth has that to do with it?" I ejaculated.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don't you see that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children. This child's disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty's sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes," cried our client. "A thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We can do nothing until seven o'clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Have you managed it?" asked Holmes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. "That is Mrs. Toller in the cellar," said she. "Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle's."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You have done well indeed!" cried Holmes with enthusiasm. "Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence Holmes' face clouded over.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I trust that we are not too late," said he. "I think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"There has been some villainy here," said Holmes; "this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter's intentions and has carried his victim off."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But how?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it." He swung himself up onto the roof. "Ah, yes," he cried, "here's the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But it is impossible," said Miss Hunter; "the ladder was not there when the Rucastles went away."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You villain!" said he, "where's your daughter?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"It is for me to ask you that," he shrieked, "you thieves! Spies and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I'll serve you!" He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"He's gone for the dog!" cried Miss Hunter.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I have my revolver," said I.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Better close the front door," cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"My God!" he cried. "Someone has loosed the dog. It's not been fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it'll be too late!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in Rucastle's throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Mrs. Toller!" cried Miss Hunter.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn't let me know what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ha!" said Holmes, looking keenly at her. "It is clear that Mrs. Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I will soon make it clear to you," said she; "and I'd have done so before now if I could ha' got out from the cellar. If there's police-court business over this, you'll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice's friend too.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn't, from the time that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend's house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle's hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn't do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death's door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn't make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Ah," said Holmes, "I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Yes, sir."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"That was it, sir."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman," said Mrs. Toller serenely.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"You have it, sir, just as it happened."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller," said Holmes, "for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle's past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.

2mo i, 1:PREFACE
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:As things now stand, the course of instruction in American history in
2mo i, 1:our public schools embraces three distinct treatments of the subject.
2mo i, 1:Three separate books are used. First, there is the primary book, which
2mo i, 1:is usually a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biographies and
2mo i, 1:anecdotes. Second, there is the advanced text for the seventh or eighth
2mo i, 1:grade, generally speaking, an expansion of the elementary book by the
2mo i, 1:addition of forty or fifty thousand words. Finally, there is the high
2mo i, 1:school manual. This, too, ordinarily follows the beaten path, giving
2mo i, 1:fuller accounts of the same events and characters. To put it bluntly, we
2mo i, 1:do not assume that our children obtain permanent possessions from their
2mo i, 1:study of history in the lower grades. If mathematicians followed the
2mo i, 1:same method, high school texts on algebra and geometry would include the
2mo i, 1:multiplication table and fractions.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:There is, of course, a ready answer to the criticism advanced above. It
2mo i, 1:is that teachers have learned from bitter experience how little history
2mo i, 1:their pupils retain as they pass along the regular route. No teacher of
2mo i, 1:history will deny this. Still it is a standing challenge to existing
2mo i, 1:methods of historical instruction. If the study of history cannot be
2mo i, 1:made truly progressive like the study of mathematics, science, and
2mo i, 1:languages, then the historians assume a grave responsibility in adding
2mo i, 1:their subject to the already overloaded curriculum. If the successive
2mo i, 1:historical texts are only enlarged editions of the first text--more
2mo i, 1:facts, more dates, more words--then history deserves most of the sharp
2mo i, 1:criticism which it is receiving from teachers of science, civics, and
2mo i, 1:economics.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In this condition of affairs we find our justification for offering a
2mo i, 1:new high school text in American history. Our first contribution is one
2mo i, 1:of omission. The time-honored stories of exploration and the
2mo i, 1:biographies of heroes are left out. We frankly hold that, if pupils know
2mo i, 1:little or nothing about Columbus, Cortes, Magellan, or Captain John
2mo i, 1:Smith by the time they reach the high school, it is useless to tell the
2mo i, 1:same stories for perhaps the fourth time. It is worse than useless. It
2mo i, 1:is an offense against the teachers of those subjects that are
2mo i, 1:demonstrated to be progressive in character.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In the next place we have omitted all descriptions of battles. Our
2mo i, 1:reasons for this are simple. The strategy of a campaign or of a single
2mo i, 1:battle is a highly technical, and usually a highly controversial, matter
2mo i, 1:about which experts differ widely. In the field of military and naval
2mo i, 1:operations most writers and teachers of history are mere novices. To
2mo i, 1:dispose of Gettysburg or the Wilderness in ten lines or ten pages is
2mo i, 1:equally absurd to the serious student of military affairs. Any one who
2mo i, 1:compares the ordinary textbook account of a single Civil War campaign
2mo i, 1:with the account given by Ropes, for instance, will ask for no further
2mo i, 1:comment. No youth called upon to serve our country in arms would think
2mo i, 1:of turning to a high school manual for information about the art of
2mo i, 1:warfare. The dramatic scene or episode, so useful in arousing the
2mo i, 1:interest of the immature pupil, seems out of place in a book that
2mo i, 1:deliberately appeals to boys and girls on the very threshold of life's
2mo i, 1:serious responsibilities.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It is not upon negative features, however, that we rest our case. It is
2mo i, 1:rather upon constructive features.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_First._ We have written a topical, not a narrative, history. We have
2mo i, 1:tried to set forth the important aspects, problems, and movements of
2mo i, 1:each period, bringing in the narrative rather by way of illustration.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_Second._ We have emphasized those historical topics which help to
2mo i, 1:explain how our nation has come to be what it is to-day.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_Third._ We have dwelt fully upon the social and economic aspects of our
2mo i, 1:history, especially in relation to the politics of each period.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_Fourth._ We have treated the causes and results of wars, the problems
2mo i, 1:of financing and sustaining armed forces, rather than military strategy.
2mo i, 1:These are the subjects which belong to a history for civilians. These
2mo i, 1:are matters which civilians can understand--matters which they must
2mo i, 1:understand, if they are to play well their part in war and peace.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_Fifth._ By omitting the period of exploration, we have been able to
2mo i, 1:enlarge the treatment of our own time. We have given special attention
2mo i, 1:to the history of those current questions which must form the subject
2mo i, 1:matter of sound instruction in citizenship.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_Sixth._ We have borne in mind that America, with all her unique
2mo i, 1:characteristics, is a part of a general civilization. Accordingly we
2mo i, 1:have given diplomacy, foreign affairs, world relations, and the
2mo i, 1:reciprocal influences of nations their appropriate place.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_Seventh._ We have deliberately aimed at standards of maturity. The
2mo i, 1:study of a mere narrative calls mainly for the use of the memory. We
2mo i, 1:have aimed to stimulate habits of analysis, comparison, association,
2mo i, 1:reflection, and generalization--habits calculated to enlarge as well as
2mo i, 1:inform the mind. We have been at great pains to make our text clear,
2mo i, 1:simple, and direct; but we have earnestly sought to stretch the
2mo i, 1:intellects of our readers--to put them upon their mettle. Most of them
2mo i, 1:will receive the last of their formal instruction in the high school.
2mo i, 1:The world will soon expect maturity from them. Their achievements will
2mo i, 1:depend upon the possession of other powers than memory alone. The
2mo i, 1:effectiveness of their citizenship in our republic will be measured by
2mo i, 1:the excellence of their judgment as well as the fullness of their
2mo i, 1:information.

2mo i, 1:     moves a group of men and women typical of those who have

2mo i, 1:     French-Canadian, the Alaskan, the Latin-American, the
2mo i, 1:     German, the Italian, the Anglo-American, and the American
2mo i, 1:     Indian, squaw and warrior. In the place of honor in the
2mo i, 1:     center of the group, standing between the oxen on the tongue
2mo i, 1:     of the prairie schooner, is a figure, beautiful and almost
2mo i, 1:     girlish, but strong, dignified, and womanly, the Mother of
2mo i, 1:     To-morrow. Above the group rides the Spirit of Enterprise,
2mo i, 1:     flanked right and left by the Hopes of the Future in the
2mo i, 1:     person of two boys. The group as a whole is beautifully
2mo i, 1:     symbolic of the westward march of American civilization.

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE GREAT MIGRATION TO AMERICA
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The tide of migration that set in toward the shores of North America
2mo i, 1:during the early years of the seventeenth century was but one phase in
2mo i, 1:the restless and eternal movement of mankind upon the surface of the
2mo i, 1:earth. The ancient Greeks flung out their colonies in every direction,
2mo i, 1:westward as far as Gaul, across the Mediterranean, and eastward into
2mo i, 1:Asia Minor, perhaps to the very confines of India. The Romans, supported
2mo i, 1:by their armies and their government, spread their dominion beyond the
2mo i, 1:narrow lands of Italy until it stretched from the heather of Scotland to
2mo i, 1:the sands of Arabia. The Teutonic tribes, from their home beyond the
2mo i, 1:Danube and the Rhine, poured into the empire of the Caesars and made the
2mo i, 1:beginnings of modern Europe. Of this great sweep of races and empires
2mo i, 1:the settlement of America was merely a part. And it was, moreover, only
2mo i, 1:one aspect of the expansion which finally carried the peoples, the
2mo i, 1:institutions, and the trade of Europe to the very ends of the earth.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In one vital point, it must be noted, American colonization differed
2mo i, 1:from that of the ancients. The Greeks usually carried with them
2mo i, 1:affection for the government they left behind and sacred fire from the
2mo i, 1:altar of the parent city; but thousands of the immigrants who came to
2mo i, 1:America disliked the state and disowned the church of the mother
2mo i, 1:country. They established compacts of government for themselves and set
2mo i, 1:up altars of their own. They sought not only new soil to till but also
2mo i, 1:political and religious liberty for themselves and their children.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE AGENCIES OF AMERICAN COLONIZATION
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was no light matter for the English to cross three thousand miles of
2mo i, 1:water and found homes in the American wilderness at the opening of the
2mo i, 1:seventeenth century. Ships, tools, and supplies called for huge outlays
2mo i, 1:of money. Stores had to be furnished in quantities sufficient to sustain
2mo i, 1:the life of the settlers until they could gather harvests of their own.
2mo i, 1:Artisans and laborers of skill and industry had to be induced to risk
2mo i, 1:the hazards of the new world. Soldiers were required for defense and
2mo i, 1:mariners for the exploration of inland waters. Leaders of good judgment,
2mo i, 1:adept in managing men, had to be discovered. Altogether such an
2mo i, 1:enterprise demanded capital larger than the ordinary merchant or
2mo i, 1:gentleman could amass and involved risks more imminent than he dared to
2mo i, 1:assume. Though in later days, after initial tests had been made, wealthy
2mo i, 1:proprietors were able to establish colonies on their own account, it was
2mo i, 1:the corporation that furnished the capital and leadership in the
2mo i, 1:beginning.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Trading Company.=--English pioneers in exploration found an
2mo i, 1:instrument for colonization in companies of merchant adventurers, which
2mo i, 1:had long been employed in carrying on commerce with foreign countries.
2mo i, 1:Such a corporation was composed of many persons of different ranks of
2mo i, 1:society--noblemen, merchants, and gentlemen--who banded together for a
2mo i, 1:particular undertaking, each contributing a sum of money and sharing in
2mo i, 1:the profits of the venture. It was organized under royal authority; it
2mo i, 1:received its charter, its grant of land, and its trading privileges from
2mo i, 1:the king and carried on its operations under his supervision and
2mo i, 1:control. The charter named all the persons originally included in the
2mo i, 1:corporation and gave them certain powers in the management of its
2mo i, 1:affairs, including the right to admit new members. The company was in
2mo i, 1:fact a little government set up by the king. When the members of the
2mo i, 1:corporation remained in England, as in the case of the Virginia Company,
2mo i, 1:they operated through agents sent to the colony. When they came over the
2mo i, 1:seas themselves and settled in America, as in the case of Massachusetts,
2mo i, 1:they became the direct government of the country they possessed. The
2mo i, 1:stockholders in that instance became the voters and the governor, the
2mo i, 1:chief magistrate.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: JOHN WINTHROP, GOVERNOR OF THE MASSACHUSETTS BAY
2mo i, 1:COMPANY]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Four of the thirteen colonies in America owed their origins to the
2mo i, 1:trading corporation. It was the London Company, created by King James I,
2mo i, 1:in 1606, that laid during the following year the foundations of Virginia
2mo i, 1:at Jamestown. It was under the auspices of their West India Company,
2mo i, 1:chartered in 1621, that the Dutch planted the settlements of the New
2mo i, 1:Netherland in the valley of the Hudson. The founders of Massachusetts
2mo i, 1:were Puritan leaders and men of affairs whom King Charles I incorporated
2mo i, 1:in 1629 under the title: "The governor and company of the Massachusetts
2mo i, 1:Bay in New England." In this case the law did but incorporate a group
2mo i, 1:drawn together by religious ties. "We must be knit together as one man,"
2mo i, 1:wrote John Winthrop, the first Puritan governor in America. Far to the
2mo i, 1:south, on the banks of the Delaware River, a Swedish commercial company
2mo i, 1:in 1638 made the beginnings of a settlement, christened New Sweden; it
2mo i, 1:was destined to pass under the rule of the Dutch, and finally under the
2mo i, 1:rule of William Penn as the proprietary colony of Delaware.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In a certain sense, Georgia may be included among the "company
2mo i, 1:colonies." It was, however, originally conceived by the moving spirit,
2mo i, 1:James Oglethorpe, as an asylum for poor men, especially those imprisoned
2mo i, 1:for debt. To realize this humane purpose, he secured from King George
2mo i, 1:II, in 1732, a royal charter uniting several gentlemen, including
2mo i, 1:himself, into "one body politic and corporate," known as the "Trustees
2mo i, 1:for establishing the colony of Georgia in America." In the structure of
2mo i, 1:their organization and their methods of government, the trustees did not
2mo i, 1:differ materially from the regular companies created for trade and
2mo i, 1:colonization. Though their purposes were benevolent, their transactions
2mo i, 1:had to be under the forms of law and according to the rules of business.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Religious Congregation.=--A second agency which figured largely in
2mo i, 1:the settlement of America was the religious brotherhood, or
2mo i, 1:congregation, of men and women brought together in the bonds of a common
2mo i, 1:religious faith. By one of the strange fortunes of history, this
2mo i, 1:institution, founded in the early days of Christianity, proved to be a
2mo i, 1:potent force in the origin and growth of self-government in a land far
2mo i, 1:away from Galilee. "And the multitude of them that believed were of one
2mo i, 1:heart and of one soul," we are told in the Acts describing the Church at
2mo i, 1:Jerusalem. "We are knit together as a body in a most sacred covenant of
2mo i, 1:the Lord ... by virtue of which we hold ourselves strictly tied to all
2mo i, 1:care of each other's good and of the whole," wrote John Robinson, a
2mo i, 1:leader among the Pilgrims who founded their tiny colony of Plymouth in
2mo i, 1:1620. The Mayflower Compact, so famous in American history, was but a
2mo i, 1:written and signed agreement, incorporating the spirit of obedience to
2mo i, 1:the common good, which served as a guide to self-government until
2mo i, 1:Plymouth was annexed to Massachusetts in 1691.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: THE ORIGINAL GRANTS]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Three other colonies, all of which retained their identity until the eve
2mo i, 1:of the American Revolution, likewise sprang directly from the
2mo i, 1:congregations of the faithful: Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New
2mo i, 1:Hampshire, mainly offshoots from Massachusetts. They were founded by
2mo i, 1:small bodies of men and women, "united in solemn covenants with the
2mo i, 1:Lord," who planted their settlements in the wilderness. Not until many a
2mo i, 1:year after Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson conducted their followers
2mo i, 1:to the Narragansett country was Rhode Island granted a charter of
2mo i, 1:incorporation (1663) by the crown. Not until long after the congregation
2mo i, 1:of Thomas Hooker from Newtown blazed the way into the Connecticut River
2mo i, 1:Valley did the king of England give Connecticut a charter of its own
2mo i, 1:(1662) and a place among the colonies. Half a century elapsed before the
2mo i, 1:towns laid out beyond the Merrimac River by emigrants from Massachusetts
2mo i, 1:were formed into the royal province of New Hampshire in 1679.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Even when Connecticut was chartered, the parchment and sealing wax of
2mo i, 1:the royal lawyers did but confirm rights and habits of self-government
2mo i, 1:and obedience to law previously established by the congregations. The
2mo i, 1:towns of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield had long lived happily
2mo i, 1:under their "Fundamental Orders" drawn up by themselves in 1639; so had
2mo i, 1:the settlers dwelt peacefully at New Haven under their "Fundamental
2mo i, 1:Articles" drafted in the same year. The pioneers on the Connecticut
2mo i, 1:shore had no difficulty in agreeing that "the Scriptures do hold forth a
2mo i, 1:perfect rule for the direction and government of all men."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Proprietor.=--A third and very important colonial agency was the
2mo i, 1:proprietor, or proprietary. As the name, associated with the word
2mo i, 1:"property," implies, the proprietor was a person to whom the king
2mo i, 1:granted property in lands in North America to have, hold, use, and enjoy
2mo i, 1:for his own benefit and profit, with the right to hand the estate down
2mo i, 1:to his heirs in perpetual succession. The proprietor was a rich and
2mo i, 1:powerful person, prepared to furnish or secure the capital, collect the
2mo i, 1:ships, supply the stores, and assemble the settlers necessary to found
2mo i, 1:and sustain a plantation beyond the seas. Sometimes the proprietor
2mo i, 1:worked alone. Sometimes two or more were associated like partners in the
2mo i, 1:common undertaking.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Five colonies, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and the Carolinas,
2mo i, 1:owe their formal origins, though not always their first settlements, nor
2mo i, 1:in most cases their prosperity, to the proprietary system. Maryland,
2mo i, 1:established in 1634 under a Catholic nobleman, Lord Baltimore, and
2mo i, 1:blessed with religious toleration by the act of 1649, flourished under
2mo i, 1:the mild rule of proprietors until it became a state in the American
2mo i, 1:union. New Jersey, beginning its career under two proprietors, Berkeley
2mo i, 1:and Carteret, in 1664, passed under the direct government of the crown
2mo i, 1:in 1702. Pennsylvania was, in a very large measure, the product of the
2mo i, 1:generous spirit and tireless labors of its first proprietor, the leader
2mo i, 1:of the Friends, William Penn, to whom it was granted in 1681 and in
2mo i, 1:whose family it remained until 1776. The two Carolinas were first
2mo i, 1:organized as one colony in 1663 under the government and patronage of
2mo i, 1:eight proprietors, including Lord Clarendon; but after more than half a
2mo i, 1:century both became royal provinces governed by the king.

2mo i, 1:THE COLONIAL PEOPLES
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The English.=--In leadership and origin the thirteen colonies, except
2mo i, 1:New York and Delaware, were English. During the early days of all, save
2mo i, 1:these two, the main, if not the sole, current of immigration was from
2mo i, 1:England. The colonists came from every walk of life. They were men,
2mo i, 1:women, and children of "all sorts and conditions." The major portion
2mo i, 1:were yeomen, or small land owners, farm laborers, and artisans. With
2mo i, 1:them were merchants and gentlemen who brought their stocks of goods or
2mo i, 1:their fortunes to the New World. Scholars came from Oxford and
2mo i, 1:Cambridge to preach the gospel or to teach. Now and then the son of an
2mo i, 1:English nobleman left his baronial hall behind and cast his lot with
2mo i, 1:America. The people represented every religious faith--members of the
2mo i, 1:Established Church of England; Puritans who had labored to reform that
2mo i, 1:church; Separatists, Baptists, and Friends, who had left it altogether;
2mo i, 1:and Catholics, who clung to the religion of their fathers.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:New England was almost purely English. During the years between 1629 and
2mo i, 1:1640, the period of arbitrary Stuart government, about twenty thousand
2mo i, 1:Puritans emigrated to America, settling in the colonies of the far
2mo i, 1:North. Although minor additions were made from time to time, the greater
2mo i, 1:portion of the New England people sprang from this original stock.
2mo i, 1:Virginia, too, for a long time drew nearly all her immigrants from
2mo i, 1:England alone. Not until the eve of the Revolution did other
2mo i, 1:nationalities, mainly the Scotch-Irish and Germans, rival the English in
2mo i, 1:numbers.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The populations of later English colonies--the Carolinas, New York,
2mo i, 1:Pennsylvania, and Georgia--while receiving a steady stream of
2mo i, 1:immigration from England, were constantly augmented by wanderers from
2mo i, 1:the older settlements. New York was invaded by Puritans from New England
2mo i, 1:in such numbers as to cause the Anglican clergymen there to lament that
2mo i, 1:"free thinking spreads almost as fast as the Church." North Carolina was
2mo i, 1:first settled toward the northern border by immigrants from Virginia.
2mo i, 1:Some of the North Carolinians, particularly the Quakers, came all the
2mo i, 1:way from New England, tarrying in Virginia only long enough to learn how
2mo i, 1:little they were wanted in that Anglican colony.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Scotch-Irish.=--Next to the English in numbers and influence were
2mo i, 1:the Scotch-Irish, Presbyterians in belief, English in tongue. Both
2mo i, 1:religious and economic reasons sent them across the sea. Their Scotch
2mo i, 1:ancestors, in the days of Cromwell, had settled in the north of Ireland
2mo i, 1:whence the native Irish had been driven by the conqueror's sword. There
2mo i, 1:the Scotch nourished for many years enjoying in peace their own form of
2mo i, 1:religion and growing prosperous in the manufacture of fine linen and
2mo i, 1:woolen cloth. Then the blow fell. Toward the end of the seventeenth
2mo i, 1:century their religious worship was put under the ban and the export of
2mo i, 1:their cloth was forbidden by the English Parliament. Within two decades
2mo i, 1:twenty thousand Scotch-Irish left Ulster alone, for America; and all
2mo i, 1:during the eighteenth century the migration continued to be heavy.
2mo i, 1:Although no exact record was kept, it is reckoned that the Scotch-Irish
2mo i, 1:and the Scotch who came directly from Scotland, composed one-sixth of
2mo i, 1:the entire American population on the eve of the Revolution.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: SETTLEMENTS OF GERMAN AND SCOTCH-IRISH
2mo i, 1:IMMIGRANTS]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:These newcomers in America made their homes chiefly in New Jersey,
2mo i, 1:Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas. Coming late upon
2mo i, 1:the scene, they found much of the land immediately upon the seaboard
2mo i, 1:already taken up. For this reason most of them became frontier people
2mo i, 1:settling the interior and upland regions. There they cleared the land,
2mo i, 1:laid out their small farms, and worked as "sturdy yeomen on the soil,"
2mo i, 1:hardy, industrious, and independent in spirit, sharing neither the
2mo i, 1:luxuries of the rich planters nor the easy life of the leisurely
2mo i, 1:merchants. To their agriculture they added woolen and linen
2mo i, 1:manufactures, which, flourishing in the supple fingers of their tireless
2mo i, 1:women, made heavy inroads upon the trade of the English merchants in
2mo i, 1:the colonies. Of their labors a poet has sung:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:        "O, willing hands to toil;
2mo i, 1:    Strong natures tuned to the harvest-song and bound to the kindly soil;
2mo i, 1:    Bold pioneers for the wilderness, defenders in the field."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Germans.=--Third among the colonists in order of numerical
2mo i, 1:importance were the Germans. From the very beginning, they appeared in
2mo i, 1:colonial records. A number of the artisans and carpenters in the first
2mo i, 1:Jamestown colony were of German descent. Peter Minuit, the famous
2mo i, 1:governor of New Motherland, was a German from Wesel on the Rhine, and
2mo i, 1:Jacob Leisler, leader of a popular uprising against the provincial
2mo i, 1:administration of New York, was a German from Frankfort-on-Main. The
2mo i, 1:wholesale migration of Germans began with the founding of Pennsylvania.
2mo i, 1:Penn was diligent in searching for thrifty farmers to cultivate his
2mo i, 1:lands and he made a special effort to attract peasants from the Rhine
2mo i, 1:country. A great association, known as the Frankfort Company, bought
2mo i, 1:more than twenty thousand acres from him and in 1684 established a
2mo i, 1:center at Germantown for the distribution of German immigrants. In old
2mo i, 1:New York, Rhinebeck-on-the-Hudson became a similar center for
2mo i, 1:distribution. All the way from Maine to Georgia inducements were offered
2mo i, 1:to the German farmers and in nearly every colony were to be found, in
2mo i, 1:time, German settlements. In fact the migration became so large that
2mo i, 1:German princes were frightened at the loss of so many subjects and
2mo i, 1:England was alarmed by the influx of foreigners into her overseas
2mo i, 1:dominions. Yet nothing could stop the movement. By the end of the
2mo i, 1:colonial period, the number of Germans had risen to more than two
2mo i, 1:hundred thousand.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The majority of them were Protestants from the Rhine region, and South
2mo i, 1:Germany. Wars, religious controversies, oppression, and poverty drove
2mo i, 1:them forth to America. Though most of them were farmers, there were also
2mo i, 1:among them skilled artisans who contributed to the rapid growth of
2mo i, 1:industries in Pennsylvania. Their iron, glass, paper, and woolen mills,
2mo i, 1:dotted here and there among the thickly settled regions, added to the
2mo i, 1:wealth and independence of the province.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: _From an old print_
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:A GLIMPSE OF OLD GERMANTOWN]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Unlike the Scotch-Irish, the Germans did not speak the language of the
2mo i, 1:original colonists or mingle freely with them. They kept to themselves,
2mo i, 1:built their own schools, founded their own newspapers, and published
2mo i, 1:their own books. Their clannish habits often irritated their neighbors
2mo i, 1:and led to occasional agitations against "foreigners." However, no
2mo i, 1:serious collisions seem to have occurred; and in the days of the
2mo i, 1:Revolution, German soldiers from Pennsylvania fought in the patriot
2mo i, 1:armies side by side with soldiers from the English and Scotch-Irish
2mo i, 1:sections.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Other Nationalities.=--Though the English, the Scotch-Irish, and the
2mo i, 1:Germans made up the bulk of the colonial population, there were other
2mo i, 1:racial strains as well, varying in numerical importance but contributing
2mo i, 1:their share to colonial life.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:From France came the Huguenots fleeing from the decree of the king which
2mo i, 1:inflicted terrible penalties upon Protestants.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:From "Old Ireland" came thousands of native Irish, Celtic in race and
2mo i, 1:Catholic in religion. Like their Scotch-Irish neighbors to the north,
2mo i, 1:they revered neither the government nor the church of England imposed
2mo i, 1:upon them by the sword. How many came we do not know, but shipping
2mo i, 1:records of the colonial period show that boatload after boatload left
2mo i, 1:the southern and eastern shores of Ireland for the New World.
2mo i, 1:Undoubtedly thousands of their passengers were Irish of the native
2mo i, 1:stock. This surmise is well sustained by the constant appearance of
2mo i, 1:Celtic names in the records of various colonies.

2mo i, 1:The Jews, then as ever engaged in their age-long battle for religious
2mo i, 1:and economic toleration, found in the American colonies, not complete
2mo i, 1:liberty, but certainly more freedom than they enjoyed in England,
2mo i, 1:France, Spain, or Portugal. The English law did not actually recognize
2mo i, 1:their right to live in any of the dominions, but owing to the easy-going
2mo i, 1:habits of the Americans they were allowed to filter into the seaboard
2mo i, 1:towns. The treatment they received there varied. On one occasion the
2mo i, 1:mayor and council of New York forbade them to sell by retail and on
2mo i, 1:another prohibited the exercise of their religious worship. Newport,
2mo i, 1:Philadelphia, and Charleston were more hospitable, and there large
2mo i, 1:Jewish colonies, consisting principally of merchants and their families,
2mo i, 1:flourished in spite of nominal prohibitions of the law.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Though the small Swedish colony in Delaware was quickly submerged
2mo i, 1:beneath the tide of English migration, the Dutch in New York continued
2mo i, 1:to hold their own for more than a hundred years after the English
2mo i, 1:conquest in 1664. At the end of the colonial period over one-half of the
2mo i, 1:170,000 inhabitants of the province were descendants of the original
2mo i, 1:Dutch--still distinct enough to give a decided cast to the life and
2mo i, 1:manners of New York. Many of them clung as tenaciously to their mother
2mo i, 1:tongue as they did to their capacious farmhouses or their Dutch ovens;
2mo i, 1:but they were slowly losing their identity as the English pressed in
2mo i, 1:beside them to farm and trade.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The melting pot had begun its historic mission.

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE PROCESS OF COLONIZATION
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Considered from one side, colonization, whatever the motives of the
2mo i, 1:emigrants, was an economic matter. It involved the use of capital to pay
2mo i, 1:for their passage, to sustain them on the voyage, and to start them on
2mo i, 1:the way of production. Under this stern economic necessity, Puritans,
2mo i, 1:Scotch-Irish, Germans, and all were alike laid.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Immigrants Who Paid Their Own Way.=--Many of the immigrants to America
2mo i, 1:in colonial days were capitalists themselves, in a small or a large way,
2mo i, 1:and paid their own passage. What proportion of the colonists were able
2mo i, 1:to finance their voyage across the sea is a matter of pure conjecture.
2mo i, 1:Undoubtedly a very considerable number could do so, for we can trace the
2mo i, 1:family fortunes of many early settlers. Henry Cabot Lodge is authority
2mo i, 1:for the statement that "the settlers of New England were drawn from the
2mo i, 1:country gentlemen, small farmers, and yeomanry of the mother
2mo i, 1:country.... Many of the emigrants were men of wealth, as the old lists
2mo i, 1:show, and all of them, with few exceptions, were men of property and
2mo i, 1:good standing. They did not belong to the classes from which emigration
2mo i, 1:is usually supplied, for they all had a stake in the country they left
2mo i, 1:behind." Though it would be interesting to know how accurate this
2mo i, 1:statement is or how applicable to the other colonies, no study has as
2mo i, 1:yet been made to gratify that interest. For the present it is an
2mo i, 1:unsolved problem just how many of the colonists were able to bear the
2mo i, 1:cost of their own transfer to the New World.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Indentured Servants.=--That at least tens of thousands of immigrants
2mo i, 1:were unable to pay for their passage is established beyond the shadow of
2mo i, 1:a doubt by the shipping records that have come down to us. The great
2mo i, 1:barrier in the way of the poor who wanted to go to America was the cost
2mo i, 1:of the sea voyage. To overcome this difficulty a plan was worked out
2mo i, 1:whereby shipowners and other persons of means furnished the passage
2mo i, 1:money to immigrants in return for their promise, or bond, to work for a
2mo i, 1:term of years to repay the sum advanced. This system was called
2mo i, 1:indentured servitude.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It is probable that the number of bond servants exceeded the original
2mo i, 1:twenty thousand Puritans, the yeomen, the Virginia gentlemen, and the
2mo i, 1:Huguenots combined. All the way down the coast from Massachusetts to
2mo i, 1:Georgia were to be found in the fields, kitchens, and workshops, men,
2mo i, 1:women, and children serving out terms of bondage generally ranging from
2mo i, 1:five to seven years. In the proprietary colonies the proportion of bond
2mo i, 1:servants was very high. The Baltimores, Penns, Carterets, and other
2mo i, 1:promoters anxiously sought for workers of every nationality to till
2mo i, 1:their fields, for land without labor was worth no more than land in the
2mo i, 1:moon. Hence the gates of the proprietary colonies were flung wide open.
2mo i, 1:Every inducement was offered to immigrants in the form of cheap land,
2mo i, 1:and special efforts were made to increase the population by importing
2mo i, 1:servants. In Pennsylvania, it was not uncommon to find a master with
2mo i, 1:fifty bond servants on his estate. It has been estimated that two-thirds
2mo i, 1:of all the immigrants into Pennsylvania between the opening of the
2mo i, 1:eighteenth century and the outbreak of the Revolution were in bondage.
2mo i, 1:In the other Middle colonies the number was doubtless not so large; but
2mo i, 1:it formed a considerable part of the population.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The story of this traffic in white servants is one of the most striking
2mo i, 1:things in the history of labor. Bondmen differed from the serfs of the
2mo i, 1:feudal age in that they were not bound to the soil but to the master.
2mo i, 1:They likewise differed from the negro slaves in that their servitude had
2mo i, 1:a time limit. Still they were subject to many special disabilities. It
2mo i, 1:was, for instance, a common practice to impose on them penalties far
2mo i, 1:heavier than were imposed upon freemen for the same offense. A free
2mo i, 1:citizen of Pennsylvania who indulged in horse racing and gambling was
2mo i, 1:let off with a fine; a white servant guilty of the same unlawful conduct
2mo i, 1:was whipped at the post and fined as well.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The ordinary life of the white servant was also severely restricted. A
2mo i, 1:bondman could not marry without his master's consent; nor engage in
2mo i, 1:trade; nor refuse work assigned to him. For an attempt to escape or
2mo i, 1:indeed for any infraction of the law, the term of service was extended.
2mo i, 1:The condition of white bondmen in Virginia, according to Lodge, "was
2mo i, 1:little better than that of slaves. Loose indentures and harsh laws put
2mo i, 1:them at the mercy of their masters." It would not be unfair to add that
2mo i, 1:such was their lot in all other colonies. Their fate depended upon the
2mo i, 1:temper of their masters.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Cruel as was the system in many ways, it gave thousands of people in the
2mo i, 1:Old World a chance to reach the New--an opportunity to wrestle with fate
2mo i, 1:for freedom and a home of their own. When their weary years of servitude
2mo i, 1:were over, if they survived, they might obtain land of their own or
2mo i, 1:settle as free mechanics in the towns. For many a bondman the gamble
2mo i, 1:proved to be a losing venture because he found himself unable to rise
2mo i, 1:out of the state of poverty and dependence into which his servitude
2mo i, 1:carried him. For thousands, on the contrary, bondage proved to be a real
2mo i, 1:avenue to freedom and prosperity. Some of the best citizens of America
2mo i, 1:have the blood of indentured servants in their veins.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Transported--Involuntary Servitude.=--In their anxiety to secure
2mo i, 1:settlers, the companies and proprietors having colonies in America
2mo i, 1:either resorted to or connived at the practice of kidnapping men, women,
2mo i, 1:and children from the streets of English cities. In 1680 it was
2mo i, 1:officially estimated that "ten thousand persons were spirited away" to
2mo i, 1:America. Many of the victims of the practice were young children, for
2mo i, 1:the traffic in them was highly profitable. Orphans and dependents were
2mo i, 1:sometimes disposed of in America by relatives unwilling to support them.
2mo i, 1:In a single year, 1627, about fifteen hundred children were shipped to
2mo i, 1:Virginia.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In this gruesome business there lurked many tragedies, and very few
2mo i, 1:romances. Parents were separated from their children and husbands from
2mo i, 1:their wives. Hundreds of skilled artisans--carpenters, smiths, and
2mo i, 1:weavers--utterly disappeared as if swallowed up by death. A few thus
2mo i, 1:dragged off to the New World to be sold into servitude for a term of
2mo i, 1:five or seven years later became prosperous and returned home with
2mo i, 1:fortunes. In one case a young man who was forcibly carried over the sea
2mo i, 1:lived to make his way back to England and establish his claim to a
2mo i, 1:peerage.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Akin to the kidnapped, at least in economic position, were convicts
2mo i, 1:deported to the colonies for life in lieu of fines and imprisonment. The
2mo i, 1:Americans protested vigorously but ineffectually against this practice.
2mo i, 1:Indeed, they exaggerated its evils, for many of the "criminals" were
2mo i, 1:only mild offenders against unduly harsh and cruel laws. A peasant
2mo i, 1:caught shooting a rabbit on a lord's estate or a luckless servant girl
2mo i, 1:who purloined a pocket handkerchief was branded as a criminal along with
2mo i, 1:sturdy thieves and incorrigible rascals. Other transported offenders
2mo i, 1:were "political criminals"; that is, persons who criticized or opposed
2mo i, 1:the government. This class included now Irish who revolted against
2mo i, 1:British rule in Ireland; now Cavaliers who championed the king against
2mo i, 1:the Puritan revolutionists; Puritans, in turn, dispatched after the
2mo i, 1:monarchy was restored; and Scotch and English subjects in general who
2mo i, 1:joined in political uprisings against the king.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The African Slaves.=--Rivaling in numbers, in the course of time, the
2mo i, 1:indentured servants and whites carried to America against their will
2mo i, 1:were the African negroes brought to America and sold into slavery. When
2mo i, 1:this form of bondage was first introduced into Virginia in 1619, it was
2mo i, 1:looked upon as a temporary necessity to be discarded with the increase
2mo i, 1:of the white population. Moreover it does not appear that those planters
2mo i, 1:who first bought negroes at the auction block intended to establish a
2mo i, 1:system of permanent bondage. Only by a slow process did chattel slavery
2mo i, 1:take firm root and become recognized as the leading source of the labor
2mo i, 1:supply. In 1650, thirty years after the introduction of slavery, there
2mo i, 1:were only three hundred Africans in Virginia.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The great increase in later years was due in no small measure to the
2mo i, 1:inordinate zeal for profits that seized slave traders both in Old and in
2mo i, 1:New England. Finding it relatively easy to secure negroes in Africa,
2mo i, 1:they crowded the Southern ports with their vessels. The English Royal
2mo i, 1:African Company sent to America annually between 1713 and 1743 from five
2mo i, 1:to ten thousand slaves. The ship owners of New England were not far
2mo i, 1:behind their English brethren in pushing this extraordinary traffic.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:As the proportion of the negroes to the free white population steadily
2mo i, 1:rose, and as whole sections were overrun with slaves and slave traders,
2mo i, 1:the Southern colonies grew alarmed. In 1710, Virginia sought to curtail
2mo i, 1:the importation by placing a duty of $5 on each slave. This effort was
2mo i, 1:futile, for the royal governor promptly vetoed it. From time to time
2mo i, 1:similar bills were passed, only to meet with royal disapproval. South
2mo i, 1:Carolina, in 1760, absolutely prohibited importation; but the measure
2mo i, 1:was killed by the British crown. As late as 1772, Virginia, not daunted
2mo i, 1:by a century of rebuffs, sent to George III a petition in this vein:
2mo i, 1:"The importation of slaves into the colonies from the coast of Africa
2mo i, 1:hath long been considered as a trade of great inhumanity and under its
2mo i, 1:present encouragement, we have too much reason to fear, will endanger
2mo i, 1:the very existence of Your Majesty's American dominions.... Deeply
2mo i, 1:impressed with these sentiments, we most humbly beseech Your Majesty to
2mo i, 1:remove all those restraints on Your Majesty's governors of this colony
2mo i, 1:which inhibit their assenting to such laws as might check so very
2mo i, 1:pernicious a commerce."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:All such protests were without avail. The negro population grew by leaps
2mo i, 1:and bounds, until on the eve of the Revolution it amounted to more than
2mo i, 1:half a million. In five states--Maryland, Virginia, the two Carolinas,
2mo i, 1:and Georgia--the slaves nearly equalled or actually exceeded the whites
2mo i, 1:in number. In South Carolina they formed almost two-thirds of the
2mo i, 1:population. Even in the Middle colonies of Delaware and Pennsylvania
2mo i, 1:about one-fifth of the inhabitants were from Africa. To the North, the
2mo i, 1:proportion of slaves steadily diminished although chattel servitude was
2mo i, 1:on the same legal footing as in the South. In New York approximately one
2mo i, 1:in six and in New England one in fifty were negroes, including a few
2mo i, 1:freedmen.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The climate, the soil, the commerce, and the industry of the North were
2mo i, 1:all unfavorable to the growth of a servile population. Still, slavery,
2mo i, 1:though sectional, was a part of the national system of economy. Northern
2mo i, 1:ships carried slaves to the Southern colonies and the produce of the
2mo i, 1:plantations to Europe. "If the Northern states will consult their
2mo i, 1:interest, they will not oppose the increase in slaves which will
2mo i, 1:increase the commodities of which they will become the carriers," said
2mo i, 1:John Rutledge, of South Carolina, in the convention which framed the
2mo i, 1:Constitution of the United States. "What enriches a part enriches the
2mo i, 1:whole and the states are the best judges of their particular interest,"
2mo i, 1:responded Oliver Ellsworth, the distinguished spokesman of Connecticut.

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE LAND AND THE WESTWARD MOVEMENT
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Significance of Land Tenure.=--The way in which land may be
2mo i, 1:acquired, held, divided among heirs, and bought and sold exercises a
2mo i, 1:deep influence on the life and culture of a people. The feudal and
2mo i, 1:aristocratic societies of Europe were founded on a system of landlordism
2mo i, 1:which was characterized by two distinct features. In the first place,
2mo i, 1:the land was nearly all held in great estates, each owned by a single
2mo i, 1:proprietor. In the second place, every estate was kept intact under the
2mo i, 1:law of primogeniture, which at the death of a lord transferred all his
2mo i, 1:landed property to his eldest son. This prevented the subdivision of
2mo i, 1:estates and the growth of a large body of small farmers or freeholders
2mo i, 1:owning their own land. It made a form of tenantry or servitude
2mo i, 1:inevitable for the mass of those who labored on the land. It also
2mo i, 1:enabled the landlords to maintain themselves in power as a governing
2mo i, 1:class and kept the tenants and laborers subject to their economic and
2mo i, 1:political control. If land tenure was so significant in Europe, it was
2mo i, 1:equally important in the development of America, where practically all
2mo i, 1:the first immigrants were forced by circumstances to derive their
2mo i, 1:livelihood from the soil.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Experiments in Common Tillage.=--In the New World, with its broad
2mo i, 1:extent of land awaiting the white man's plow, it was impossible to
2mo i, 1:introduce in its entirety and over the whole area the system of lords
2mo i, 1:and tenants that existed across the sea. So it happened that almost
2mo i, 1:every kind of experiment in land tenure, from communism to feudalism,
2mo i, 1:was tried. In the early days of the Jamestown colony, the land, though
2mo i, 1:owned by the London Company, was tilled in common by the settlers. No
2mo i, 1:man had a separate plot of his own. The motto of the community was:
2mo i, 1:"Labor and share alike." All were supposed to work in the fields and
2mo i, 1:receive an equal share of the produce. At Plymouth, the Pilgrims
2mo i, 1:attempted a similar experiment, laying out the fields in common and
2mo i, 1:distributing the joint produce of their labor with rough equality among
2mo i, 1:the workers.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In both colonies the communistic experiments were failures. Angry at the
2mo i, 1:lazy men in Jamestown who idled their time away and yet expected regular
2mo i, 1:meals, Captain John Smith issued a manifesto: "Everyone that gathereth
2mo i, 1:not every day as much as I do, the next day shall be set beyond the
2mo i, 1:river and forever banished from the fort and live there or starve." Even
2mo i, 1:this terrible threat did not bring a change in production. Not until
2mo i, 1:each man was given a plot of his own to till, not until each gathered
2mo i, 1:the fruits of his own labor, did the colony prosper. In Plymouth, where
2mo i, 1:the communal experiment lasted for five years, the results were similar
2mo i, 1:to those in Virginia, and the system was given up for one of separate
2mo i, 1:fields in which every person could "set corn for his own particular."
2mo i, 1:Some other New England towns, refusing to profit by the experience of
2mo i, 1:their Plymouth neighbor, also made excursions into common ownership and
2mo i, 1:labor, only to abandon the idea and go in for individual ownership of
2mo i, 1:the land. "By degrees it was seen that even the Lord's people could not
2mo i, 1:carry the complicated communist legislation into perfect and wholesome
2mo i, 1:practice."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Feudal Elements in the Colonies--Quit Rents, Manors, and
2mo i, 1:Plantations.=--At the other end of the scale were the feudal elements of
2mo i, 1:land tenure found in the proprietary colonies, in the seaboard regions
2mo i, 1:of the South, and to some extent in New York. The proprietor was in fact
2mo i, 1:a powerful feudal lord, owning land granted to him by royal charter. He
2mo i, 1:could retain any part of it for his personal use or dispose of it all in
2mo i, 1:large or small lots. While he generally kept for himself an estate of
2mo i, 1:baronial proportions, it was impossible for him to manage directly any
2mo i, 1:considerable part of the land in his dominion. Consequently he either
2mo i, 1:sold it in parcels for lump sums or granted it to individuals on
2mo i, 1:condition that they make to him an annual payment in money, known as
2mo i, 1:"quit rent." In Maryland, the proprietor sometimes collected as high as
2mo i, 1:$9000 (equal to about $500,000 to-day) in a single year from this
2mo i, 1:source. In Pennsylvania, the quit rents brought a handsome annual
2mo i, 1:tribute into the exchequer of the Penn family. In the royal provinces,
2mo i, 1:the king of England claimed all revenues collected in this form from the
2mo i, 1:land, a sum amounting to $19,000 at the time of the Revolution. The quit
2mo i, 1:rent,--"really a feudal payment from freeholders,"--was thus a material
2mo i, 1:source of income for the crown as well as for the proprietors. Wherever
2mo i, 1:it was laid, however, it proved to be a burden, a source of constant
2mo i, 1:irritation; and it became a formidable item in the long list of
2mo i, 1:grievances which led to the American Revolution.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Something still more like the feudal system of the Old World appeared in
2mo i, 1:the numerous manors or the huge landed estates granted by the crown, the
2mo i, 1:companies, or the proprietors. In the colony of Maryland alone there
2mo i, 1:were sixty manors of three thousand acres each, owned by wealthy men and
2mo i, 1:tilled by tenants holding small plots under certain restrictions of
2mo i, 1:tenure. In New York also there were many manors of wide extent, most of
2mo i, 1:which originated in the days of the Dutch West India Company, when
2mo i, 1:extensive concessions were made to patroons to induce them to bring over
2mo i, 1:settlers. The Van Rensselaer, the Van Cortlandt, and the Livingston
2mo i, 1:manors were so large and populous that each was entitled to send a
2mo i, 1:representative to the provincial legislature. The tenants on the New
2mo i, 1:York manors were in somewhat the same position as serfs on old European
2mo i, 1:estates. They were bound to pay the owner a rent in money and kind; they
2mo i, 1:ground their grain at his mill; and they were subject to his judicial
2mo i, 1:power because he held court and meted out justice, in some instances
2mo i, 1:extending to capital punishment.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The manors of New York or Maryland were, however, of slight consequence
2mo i, 1:as compared with the vast plantations of the Southern seaboard--huge
2mo i, 1:estates, far wider in expanse than many a European barony and tilled by
2mo i, 1:slaves more servile than any feudal tenants. It must not be forgotten
2mo i, 1:that this system of land tenure became the dominant feature of a large
2mo i, 1:section and gave a decided bent to the economic and political life of
2mo i, 1:America.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: SOUTHERN PLANTATION MANSION]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Small Freehold.=--In the upland regions of the South, however, and
2mo i, 1:throughout most of the North, the drift was against all forms of
2mo i, 1:servitude and tenantry and in the direction of the freehold; that is,
2mo i, 1:the small farm owned outright and tilled by the possessor and his
2mo i, 1:family. This was favored by natural circumstances and the spirit of the
2mo i, 1:immigrants. For one thing, the abundance of land and the scarcity of
2mo i, 1:labor made it impossible for the companies, the proprietors, or the
2mo i, 1:crown to develop over the whole continent a network of vast estates. In
2mo i, 1:many sections, particularly in New England, the climate, the stony soil,
2mo i, 1:the hills, and the narrow valleys conspired to keep the farms within a
2mo i, 1:moderate compass. For another thing, the English, Scotch-Irish, and
2mo i, 1:German peasants, even if they had been tenants in the Old World, did not
2mo i, 1:propose to accept permanent dependency of any kind in the New. If they
2mo i, 1:could not get freeholds, they would not settle at all; thus they forced
2mo i, 1:proprietors and companies to bid for their enterprise by selling land in
2mo i, 1:small lots. So it happened that the freehold of modest proportions
2mo i, 1:became the cherished unit of American farmers. The people who tilled the
2mo i, 1:farms were drawn from every quarter of western Europe; but the freehold
2mo i, 1:system gave a uniform cast to their economic and social life in America.

2mo i, 1:=Social Effects of Land Tenure.=--Land tenure and the process of western
2mo i, 1:settlement thus developed two distinct types of people engaged in the
2mo i, 1:same pursuit--agriculture. They had a common tie in that they both
2mo i, 1:cultivated the soil and possessed the local interest and independence
2mo i, 1:which arise from that occupation. Their methods and their culture,
2mo i, 1:however, differed widely.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The Southern planter, on his broad acres tilled by slaves, resembled the
2mo i, 1:English landlord on his estates more than he did the colonial farmer who
2mo i, 1:labored with his own hands in the fields and forests. He sold his rice
2mo i, 1:and tobacco in large amounts directly to English factors, who took his
2mo i, 1:entire crop in exchange for goods and cash. His fine clothes,
2mo i, 1:silverware, china, and cutlery he bought in English markets. Loving the
2mo i, 1:ripe old culture of the mother country, he often sent his sons to Oxford
2mo i, 1:or Cambridge for their education. In short, he depended very largely for
2mo i, 1:his prosperity and his enjoyment of life upon close relations with the
2mo i, 1:Old World. He did not even need market towns in which to buy native
2mo i, 1:goods, for they were made on his own plantation by his own artisans who
2mo i, 1:were usually gifted slaves.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The economic condition of the small farmer was totally different. His
2mo i, 1:crops were not big enough to warrant direct connection with English
2mo i, 1:factors or the personal maintenance of a corps of artisans. He needed
2mo i, 1:local markets, and they sprang up to meet the need. Smiths, hatters,
2mo i, 1:weavers, wagon-makers, and potters at neighboring towns supplied him
2mo i, 1:with the rough products of their native skill. The finer goods, bought
2mo i, 1:by the rich planter in England, the small farmer ordinarily could not
2mo i, 1:buy. His wants were restricted to staples like tea and sugar, and
2mo i, 1:between him and the European market stood the merchant. His community
2mo i, 1:was therefore more self-sufficient than the seaboard line of great
2mo i, 1:plantations. It was more isolated, more provincial, more independent,
2mo i, 1:more American. The planter faced the Old East. The farmer faced the New
2mo i, 1:West.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Westward Movement.=--Yeoman and planter nevertheless were alike in
2mo i, 1:one respect. Their land hunger was never appeased. Each had the eye of
2mo i, 1:an expert for new and fertile soil; and so, north and south, as soon as
2mo i, 1:a foothold was secured on the Atlantic coast, the current of migration
2mo i, 1:set in westward, creeping through forests, across rivers, and over
2mo i, 1:mountains. Many of the later immigrants, in their search for cheap
2mo i, 1:lands, were compelled to go to the border; but in a large part the path
2mo i, 1:breakers to the West were native Americans of the second and third
2mo i, 1:generations. Explorers, fired by curiosity and the lure of the
2mo i, 1:mysterious unknown, and hunters, fur traders, and squatters, following
2mo i, 1:their own sweet wills, blazed the trail, opening paths and sending back
2mo i, 1:stories of the new regions they traversed. Then came the regular
2mo i, 1:settlers with lawful titles to the lands they had purchased, sometimes
2mo i, 1:singly and sometimes in companies.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In Massachusetts, the westward movement is recorded in the founding of
2mo i, 1:Springfield in 1636 and Great Barrington in 1725. By the opening of the
2mo i, 1:eighteenth century the pioneers of Connecticut had pushed north and west
2mo i, 1:until their outpost towns adjoined the Hudson Valley settlements. In New
2mo i, 1:York, the inland movement was directed by the Hudson River to Albany,
2mo i, 1:and from that old Dutch center it radiated in every direction,
2mo i, 1:particularly westward through the Mohawk Valley. New Jersey was early
2mo i, 1:filled to its borders, the beginnings of the present city of New
2mo i, 1:Brunswick being made in 1681 and those of Trenton in 1685. In
2mo i, 1:Pennsylvania, as in New York, the waterways determined the main lines of
2mo i, 1:advance. Pioneers, pushing up through the valley of the Schuylkill,
2mo i, 1:spread over the fertile lands of Berks and Lancaster counties, laying
2mo i, 1:out Reading in 1748. Another current of migration was directed by the
2mo i, 1:Susquehanna, and, in 1726, the first farmhouse was built on the bank
2mo i, 1:where Harrisburg was later founded. Along the southern tier of counties
2mo i, 1:a thin line of settlements stretched westward to Pittsburgh, reaching
2mo i, 1:the upper waters of the Ohio while the colony was still under the Penn
2mo i, 1:family.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In the South the westward march was equally swift. The seaboard was
2mo i, 1:quickly occupied by large planters and their slaves engaged in the
2mo i, 1:cultivation of tobacco and rice. The Piedmont Plateau, lying back from
2mo i, 1:the coast all the way from Maryland to Georgia, was fed by two streams
2mo i, 1:of migration, one westward from the sea and the other southward from the
2mo i, 1:other colonies--Germans from Pennsylvania and Scotch-Irish furnishing
2mo i, 1:the main supply. "By 1770, tide-water Virginia was full to overflowing
2mo i, 1:and the 'back country' of the Blue Ridge and the Shenandoah was fully
2mo i, 1:occupied. Even the mountain valleys ... were claimed by sturdy pioneers.
2mo i, 1:Before the Declaration of Independence, the oncoming tide of
2mo i, 1:home-seekers had reached the crest of the Alleghanies."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION, 1790]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Beyond the mountains pioneers had already ventured, harbingers of an
2mo i, 1:invasion that was about to break in upon Kentucky and Tennessee. As
2mo i, 1:early as 1769 that mighty Nimrod, Daniel Boone, curious to hunt
2mo i, 1:buffaloes, of which he had heard weird reports, passed through the
2mo i, 1:Cumberland Gap and brought back news of a wonderful country awaiting the
2mo i, 1:plow. A hint was sufficient. Singly, in pairs, and in groups, settlers
2mo i, 1:followed the trail he had blazed. A great land corporation, the
2mo i, 1:Transylvania Company, emulating the merchant adventurers of earlier
2mo i, 1:times, secured a huge grant of territory and sought profits in quit
2mo i, 1:rents from lands sold to farmers. By the outbreak of the Revolution
2mo i, 1:there were several hundred people in the Kentucky region. Like the older
2mo i, 1:colonists, they did not relish quit rents, and their opposition wrecked
2mo i, 1:the Transylvania Company. They even carried their protests into the
2mo i, 1:Continental Congress in 1776, for by that time they were our "embryo
2mo i, 1:fourteenth colony."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Though the labor of the colonists was mainly spent in farming, there was
2mo i, 1:a steady growth in industrial and commercial pursuits. Most of the
2mo i, 1:staple industries of to-day, not omitting iron and textiles, have their
2mo i, 1:beginnings in colonial times. Manufacturing and trade soon gave rise to
2mo i, 1:towns which enjoyed an importance all out of proportion to their
2mo i, 1:numbers. The great centers of commerce and finance on the seaboard
2mo i, 1:originated in the days when the king of England was "lord of these
2mo i, 1:dominions."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: DOMESTIC INDUSTRY: DIPPING TALLOW CANDLES]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Textile Manufacture as a Domestic Industry.=--Colonial women, in
2mo i, 1:addition to sharing every hardship of pioneering, often the heavy labor
2mo i, 1:of the open field, developed in the course of time a national industry
2mo i, 1:which was almost exclusively their own. Wool and flax were raised in
2mo i, 1:abundance in the North and South. "Every farm house," says Coman, the
2mo i, 1:economic historian, "was a workshop where the women spun and wove the
2mo i, 1:serges, kerseys, and linsey-woolseys which served for the common wear."
2mo i, 1:By the close of the seventeenth century, New England manufactured cloth
2mo i, 1:in sufficient quantities to export it to the Southern colonies and to
2mo i, 1:the West Indies. As the industry developed, mills were erected for the
2mo i, 1:more difficult process of dyeing, weaving, and fulling, but carding and
2mo i, 1:spinning continued to be done in the home. The Dutch of New Netherland,
2mo i, 1:the Swedes of Delaware, and the Scotch-Irish of the interior "were not
2mo i, 1:one whit behind their Yankee neighbors."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The importance of this enterprise to British economic life can hardly be
2mo i, 1:overestimated. For many a century the English had employed their fine
2mo i, 1:woolen cloth as the chief staple in a lucrative foreign trade, and the
2mo i, 1:government had come to look upon it as an object of special interest and
2mo i, 1:protection. When the colonies were established, both merchants and
2mo i, 1:statesmen naturally expected to maintain a monopoly of increasing value;
2mo i, 1:but before long the Americans, instead of buying cloth, especially of
2mo i, 1:the coarser varieties, were making it to sell. In the place of
2mo i, 1:customers, here were rivals. In the place of helpless reliance upon
2mo i, 1:English markets, here was the germ of economic independence.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:If British merchants had not discovered it in the ordinary course of
2mo i, 1:trade, observant officers in the provinces would have conveyed the news
2mo i, 1:to them. Even in the early years of the eighteenth century the royal
2mo i, 1:governor of New York wrote of the industrious Americans to his home
2mo i, 1:government: "The consequence will be that if they can clothe themselves
2mo i, 1:once, not only comfortably, but handsomely too, without the help of
2mo i, 1:England, they who already are not very fond of submitting to government
2mo i, 1:will soon think of putting in execution designs they have long harboured
2mo i, 1:in their breasts. This will not seem strange when you consider what sort
2mo i, 1:of people this country is inhabited by."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Iron Industry.=--Almost equally widespread was the art of iron
2mo i, 1:working--one of the earliest and most picturesque of colonial
2mo i, 1:industries. Lynn, Massachusetts, had a forge and skilled artisans within
2mo i, 1:fifteen years after the founding of Boston. The smelting of iron began
2mo i, 1:at New London and New Haven about 1658; in Litchfield county,
2mo i, 1:Connecticut, a few years later; at Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in
2mo i, 1:1731; and near by at Lenox some thirty years after that. New Jersey had
2mo i, 1:iron works at Shrewsbury within ten years after the founding of the
2mo i, 1:colony in 1665. Iron forges appeared in the valleys of the Delaware and
2mo i, 1:the Susquehanna early in the following century, and iron masters then
2mo i, 1:laid the foundations of fortunes in a region destined to become one of
2mo i, 1:the great iron centers of the world. Virginia began iron working in the
2mo i, 1:year that saw the introduction of slavery. Although the industry soon
2mo i, 1:lapsed, it was renewed and flourished in the eighteenth century.
2mo i, 1:Governor Spotswood was called the "Tubal Cain" of the Old Dominion
2mo i, 1:because he placed the industry on a firm foundation. Indeed it seems
2mo i, 1:that every colony, except Georgia, had its iron foundry. Nails, wire,
2mo i, 1:metallic ware, chains, anchors, bar and pig iron were made in large
2mo i, 1:quantities; and Great Britain, by an act in 1750, encouraged the
2mo i, 1:colonists to export rough iron to the British Islands.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Shipbuilding.=--Of all the specialized industries in the colonies,
2mo i, 1:shipbuilding was the most important. The abundance of fir for masts, oak
2mo i, 1:for timbers and boards, pitch for tar and turpentine, and hemp for rope
2mo i, 1:made the way of the shipbuilder easy. Early in the seventeenth century a
2mo i, 1:ship was built at New Amsterdam, and by the middle of that century
2mo i, 1:shipyards were scattered along the New England coast at Newburyport,
2mo i, 1:Salem, New Bedford, Newport, Providence, New London, and New Haven.
2mo i, 1:Yards at Albany and Poughkeepsie in New York built ships for the trade
2mo i, 1:of that colony with England and the Indies. Wilmington and Philadelphia
2mo i, 1:soon entered the race and outdistanced New York, though unable to equal
2mo i, 1:the pace set by New England. While Maryland, Virginia, and South
2mo i, 1:Carolina also built ships, Southern interest was mainly confined to the
2mo i, 1:lucrative business of producing ship materials: fir, cedar, hemp, and
2mo i, 1:tar.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Fishing.=--The greatest single economic resource of New England outside
2mo i, 1:of agriculture was the fisheries. This industry, started by hardy
2mo i, 1:sailors from Europe, long before the landing of the Pilgrims, flourished
2mo i, 1:under the indomitable seamanship of the Puritans, who labored with the
2mo i, 1:net and the harpoon in almost every quarter of the Atlantic. "Look,"
2mo i, 1:exclaimed Edmund Burke, in the House of Commons, "at the manner in
2mo i, 1:which the people of New England have of late carried on the whale
2mo i, 1:fishery. Whilst we follow them among the tumbling mountains of ice and
2mo i, 1:behold them penetrating into the deepest frozen recesses of Hudson's Bay
2mo i, 1:and Davis's Straits, while we are looking for them beneath the arctic
2mo i, 1:circle, we hear that they have pierced into the opposite region of polar
2mo i, 1:cold, that they are at the antipodes and engaged under the frozen
2mo i, 1:serpent of the south.... Nor is the equinoctial heat more discouraging
2mo i, 1:to them than the accumulated winter of both poles. We know that, whilst
2mo i, 1:some of them draw the line and strike the harpoon on the coast of
2mo i, 1:Africa, others run the longitude and pursue their gigantic game along
2mo i, 1:the coast of Brazil. No sea but what is vexed by their fisheries. No
2mo i, 1:climate that is not witness to their toils. Neither the perseverance of
2mo i, 1:Holland nor the activity of France nor the dexterous and firm sagacity
2mo i, 1:of English enterprise ever carried this most perilous mode of hard
2mo i, 1:industry to the extent to which it has been pushed by this recent
2mo i, 1:people."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The influence of the business was widespread. A large and lucrative
2mo i, 1:European trade was built upon it. The better quality of the fish caught
2mo i, 1:for food was sold in the markets of Spain, Portugal, and Italy, or
2mo i, 1:exchanged for salt, lemons, and raisins for the American market. The
2mo i, 1:lower grades of fish were carried to the West Indies for slave
2mo i, 1:consumption, and in part traded for sugar and molasses, which furnished
2mo i, 1:the raw materials for the thriving rum industry of New England. These
2mo i, 1:activities, in turn, stimulated shipbuilding, steadily enlarging the
2mo i, 1:demand for fishing and merchant craft of every kind and thus keeping the
2mo i, 1:shipwrights, calkers, rope makers, and other artisans of the seaport
2mo i, 1:towns rushed with work. They also increased trade with the mother
2mo i, 1:country for, out of the cash collected in the fish markets of Europe and
2mo i, 1:the West Indies, the colonists paid for English manufactures. So an
2mo i, 1:ever-widening circle of American enterprise centered around this single
2mo i, 1:industry, the nursery of seamanship and the maritime spirit.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Oceanic Commerce and American Merchants.=--All through the eighteenth
2mo i, 1:century, the commerce of the American colonies spread in every direction
2mo i, 1:until it rivaled in the number of people employed, the capital engaged,
2mo i, 1:and the profits gleaned, the commerce of European nations. A modern
2mo i, 1:historian has said: "The enterprising merchants of New England developed
2mo i, 1:a network of trade routes that covered well-nigh half the world." This
2mo i, 1:commerce, destined to be of such significance in the conflict with the
2mo i, 1:mother country, presented, broadly speaking, two aspects.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:On the one side, it involved the export of raw materials and
2mo i, 1:agricultural produce. The Southern colonies produced for shipping,
2mo i, 1:tobacco, rice, tar, pitch, and pine; the Middle colonies, grain, flour,
2mo i, 1:furs, lumber, and salt pork; New England, fish, flour, rum, furs, shoes,
2mo i, 1:and small articles of manufacture. The variety of products was in fact
2mo i, 1:astounding. A sarcastic writer, while sneering at the idea of an
2mo i, 1:American union, once remarked of colonial trade: "What sort of dish will
2mo i, 1:you make? New England will throw in fish and onions. The middle states,
2mo i, 1:flax-seed and flour. Maryland and Virginia will add tobacco. North
2mo i, 1:Carolina, pitch, tar, and turpentine. South Carolina, rice and indigo,
2mo i, 1:and Georgia will sprinkle the whole composition with sawdust. Such an
2mo i, 1:absurd jumble will you make if you attempt to form a union among such
2mo i, 1:discordant materials as the thirteen British provinces."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:On the other side, American commerce involved the import trade,
2mo i, 1:consisting principally of English and continental manufactures, tea, and
2mo i, 1:"India goods." Sugar and molasses, brought from the West Indies,
2mo i, 1:supplied the flourishing distilleries of Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
2mo i, 1:and Connecticut. The carriage of slaves from Africa to the Southern
2mo i, 1:colonies engaged hundreds of New England's sailors and thousands of
2mo i, 1:pounds of her capital.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The disposition of imported goods in the colonies, though in part
2mo i, 1:controlled by English factors located in America, employed also a large
2mo i, 1:and important body of American merchants like the Willings and Morrises
2mo i, 1:of Philadelphia; the Amorys, Hancocks, and Faneuils of Boston; and the
2mo i, 1:Livingstons and Lows of New York. In their zeal and enterprise, they
2mo i, 1:were worthy rivals of their English competitors, so celebrated for
2mo i, 1:world-wide commercial operations. Though fully aware of the advantages
2mo i, 1:they enjoyed in British markets and under the protection of the British
2mo i, 1:navy, the American merchants were high-spirited and mettlesome, ready to
2mo i, 1:contend with royal officers in order to shield American interests
2mo i, 1:against outside interference.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: THE DUTCH WEST INDIA WAREHOUSE IN NEW AMSTERDAM
2mo i, 1:(NEW YORK CITY)]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Measured against the immense business of modern times, colonial commerce
2mo i, 1:seems perhaps trivial. That, however, is not the test of its
2mo i, 1:significance. It must be considered in relation to the growth of English
2mo i, 1:colonial trade in its entirety--a relation which can be shown by a few
2mo i, 1:startling figures. The whole export trade of England, including that to
2mo i, 1:the colonies, was, in 1704, $6,509,000. On the eve of the American
2mo i, 1:Revolution, namely, in 1772, English exports to the American colonies
2mo i, 1:alone amounted to $6,024,000; in other words, almost as much as the
2mo i, 1:whole foreign business of England two generations before. At the first
2mo i, 1:date, colonial trade was but one-twelfth of the English export business;
2mo i, 1:at the second date, it was considerably more than one-third. In 1704,
2mo i, 1:Pennsylvania bought in English markets goods to the value of $11,459; in
2mo i, 1:1772 the purchases of the same colony amounted to $507,909. In short,
2mo i, 1:Pennsylvania imports increased fifty times within sixty-eight years,
2mo i, 1:amounting in 1772 to almost the entire export trade of England to the
2mo i, 1:colonies at the opening of the century. The American colonies were
2mo i, 1:indeed a great source of wealth to English merchants.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Intercolonial Commerce.=--Although the bad roads of colonial times made
2mo i, 1:overland transportation difficult and costly, the many rivers and
2mo i, 1:harbors along the coast favored a lively water-borne trade among the
2mo i, 1:colonies. The Connecticut, Hudson, Delaware, and Susquehanna rivers in
2mo i, 1:the North and the many smaller rivers in the South made it possible for
2mo i, 1:goods to be brought from, and carried to, the interior regions in little
2mo i, 1:sailing vessels with comparative ease. Sloops laden with manufactures,
2mo i, 1:domestic and foreign, collected at some city like Providence, New York,
2mo i, 1:or Philadelphia, skirted the coasts, visited small ports, and sailed up
2mo i, 1:the navigable rivers to trade with local merchants who had for exchange
2mo i, 1:the raw materials which they had gathered in from neighboring farms.
2mo i, 1:Larger ships carried the grain, live stock, cloth, and hardware of New
2mo i, 1:England to the Southern colonies, where they were traded for tobacco,
2mo i, 1:leather, tar, and ship timber. From the harbors along the Connecticut
2mo i, 1:shores there were frequent sailings down through Long Island Sound to
2mo i, 1:Maryland, Virginia, and the distant Carolinas.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Growth of Towns.=--In connection with this thriving trade and industry
2mo i, 1:there grew up along the coast a number of prosperous commercial centers
2mo i, 1:which were soon reckoned among the first commercial towns of the whole
2mo i, 1:British empire, comparing favorably in numbers and wealth with such
2mo i, 1:ports as Liverpool and Bristol. The statistical records of that time are
2mo i, 1:mainly guesses; but we know that Philadelphia stood first in size among
2mo i, 1:these towns. Serving as the port of entry for Pennsylvania, Delaware,
2mo i, 1:and western Jersey, it had drawn within its borders, just before the
2mo i, 1:Revolution, about 25,000 inhabitants. Boston was second in rank, with
2mo i, 1:somewhat more than 20,000 people. New York, the "commercial capital of
2mo i, 1:Connecticut and old East Jersey," was slightly smaller than Boston, but
2mo i, 1:growing at a steady rate. The fourth town in size was Charleston, South
2mo i, 1:Carolina, with about 10,000 inhabitants. Newport in Rhode Island, a
2mo i, 1:center of rum manufacture and shipping, stood fifth, with a population
2mo i, 1:of about 7000. Baltimore and Norfolk were counted as "considerable
2mo i, 1:towns." In the interior, Hartford in Connecticut, Lancaster and York in
2mo i, 1:Pennsylvania, and Albany in New York, with growing populations and
2mo i, 1:increasing trade, gave prophecy of an urban America away from the
2mo i, 1:seaboard. The other towns were straggling villages. Williamsburg,
2mo i, 1:Virginia, for example, had about two hundred houses, in which dwelt a
2mo i, 1:dozen families of the gentry and a few score of tradesmen. Inland county
2mo i, 1:seats often consisted of nothing more than a log courthouse, a prison,
2mo i, 1:and one wretched inn to house judges, lawyers, and litigants during the
2mo i, 1:sessions of the court.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The leading towns exercised an influence on colonial opinion all out of
2mo i, 1:proportion to their population. They were the centers of wealth, for one
2mo i, 1:thing; of the press and political activity, for another. Merchants and
2mo i, 1:artisans could readily take concerted action on public questions arising
2mo i, 1:from their commercial operations. The towns were also centers for news,
2mo i, 1:gossip, religious controversy, and political discussion. In the market
2mo i, 1:places the farmers from the countryside learned of British policies and
2mo i, 1:laws, and so, mingling with the townsmen, were drawn into the main
2mo i, 1:currents of opinion which set in toward colonial nationalism and
2mo i, 1:independence.

2mo i, 1:SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PROGRESS
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Colonial life, crowded as it was with hard and unremitting toil, left
2mo i, 1:scant leisure for the cultivation of the arts and sciences. There was
2mo i, 1:little money in private purses or public treasuries to be dedicated to
2mo i, 1:schools, libraries, and museums. Few there were with time to read long
2mo i, 1:and widely, and fewer still who could devote their lives to things that
2mo i, 1:delight the eye and the mind. And yet, poor and meager as the
2mo i, 1:intellectual life of the colonists may seem by way of comparison, heroic
2mo i, 1:efforts were made in every community to lift the people above the plane
2mo i, 1:of mere existence. After the first clearings were opened in the forests
2mo i, 1:those efforts were redoubled, and with lengthening years told upon the
2mo i, 1:thought and spirit of the land. The appearance, during the struggle with
2mo i, 1:England, of an extraordinary group of leaders familiar with history,
2mo i, 1:political philosophy, and the arts of war, government, and diplomacy
2mo i, 1:itself bore eloquent testimony to the high quality of the American
2mo i, 1:intellect. No one, not even the most critical, can run through the
2mo i, 1:writings of distinguished Americans scattered from Massachusetts to
2mo i, 1:Georgia--the Adamses, Ellsworth, the Morrises, the Livingstons,
2mo i, 1:Hamilton, Franklin, Washington, Madison, Marshall, Henry, the Randolphs,
2mo i, 1:and the Pinckneys--without coming to the conclusion that there was
2mo i, 1:something in American colonial life which fostered minds of depth and
2mo i, 1:power. Women surmounted even greater difficulties than the men in the
2mo i, 1:process of self-education, and their keen interest in public issues is
2mo i, 1:evident in many a record like the _Letters_ of Mrs. John Adams to her
2mo i, 1:husband during the Revolution; the writings of Mrs. Mercy Otis Warren,
2mo i, 1:the sister of James Otis, who measured her pen with the British
2mo i, 1:propagandists; and the patriot newspapers founded and managed by women.

2mo i, 1:THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHURCHES
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In the intellectual life of America, the churches assumed a role of high
2mo i, 1:importance. There were abundant reasons for this. In many of the
2mo i, 1:colonies--Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New England--the religious impulse
2mo i, 1:had been one of the impelling motives in stimulating immigration. In all
2mo i, 1:the colonies, the clergy, at least in the beginning, formed the only
2mo i, 1:class with any leisure to devote to matters of the spirit. They preached
2mo i, 1:on Sundays and taught school on week days. They led in the discussion of
2mo i, 1:local problems and in the formation of political opinion, so much of
2mo i, 1:which was concerned with the relation between church and state. They
2mo i, 1:wrote books and pamphlets. They filled most of the chairs in the
2mo i, 1:colleges; under clerical guidance, intellectual and spiritual, the
2mo i, 1:Americans received their formal education. In several of the provinces
2mo i, 1:the Anglican Church was established by law. In New England the Puritans
2mo i, 1:were supreme, notwithstanding the efforts of the crown to overbear their
2mo i, 1:authority. In the Middle colonies, particularly, the multiplication of
2mo i, 1:sects made the dominance of any single denomination impossible; and in
2mo i, 1:all of them there was a growing diversity of faith, which promised in
2mo i, 1:time a separation of church and state and freedom of opinion.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Church of England.=--Virginia was the stronghold of the English
2mo i, 1:system of church and state. The Anglican faith and worship were
2mo i, 1:prescribed by law, sustained by taxes imposed on all, and favored by the
2mo i, 1:governor, the provincial councilors, and the richest planters. "The
2mo i, 1:Established Church," says Lodge, "was one of the appendages of the
2mo i, 1:Virginia aristocracy. They controlled the vestries and the ministers,
2mo i, 1:and the parish church stood not infrequently on the estate of the
2mo i, 1:planter who built and managed it." As in England, Catholics and
2mo i, 1:Protestant Dissenters were at first laid under heavy disabilities. Only
2mo i, 1:slowly and on sufferance were they admitted to the province; but when
2mo i, 1:once they were even covertly tolerated, they pressed steadily in, until,
2mo i, 1:by the Revolution, they outnumbered the adherents of the established
2mo i, 1:order.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The Church was also sanctioned by law and supported by taxes in the
2mo i, 1:Carolinas after 1704, and in Georgia after that colony passed directly
2mo i, 1:under the crown in 1754--this in spite of the fact that the majority of
2mo i, 1:the inhabitants were Dissenters. Against the protests of the Catholics
2mo i, 1:it was likewise established in Maryland. In New York, too,
2mo i, 1:notwithstanding the resistance of the Dutch, the Established Church was
2mo i, 1:fostered by the provincial officials, and the Anglicans, embracing about
2mo i, 1:one-fifteenth of the population, exerted an influence all out of
2mo i, 1:proportion to their numbers.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Many factors helped to enhance the power of the English Church in the
2mo i, 1:colonies. It was supported by the British government and the official
2mo i, 1:class sent out to the provinces. Its bishops and archbishops in England
2mo i, 1:were appointed by the king, and its faith and service were set forth by
2mo i, 1:acts of Parliament. Having its seat of power in the English monarchy, it
2mo i, 1:could hold its clergy and missionaries loyal to the crown and so
2mo i, 1:counteract to some extent the independent spirit that was growing up in
2mo i, 1:America. The Church, always a strong bulwark of the state, therefore had
2mo i, 1:a political role to play here as in England. Able bishops and far-seeing
2mo i, 1:leaders firmly grasped this fact about the middle of the eighteenth
2mo i, 1:century and redoubled their efforts to augment the influence of the
2mo i, 1:Church in provincial affairs. Unhappily for their plans they failed to
2mo i, 1:calculate in advance the effect of their methods upon dissenting
2mo i, 1:Protestants, who still cherished memories of bitter religious conflicts
2mo i, 1:in the mother country.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Puritanism in New England.=--If the established faith made for imperial
2mo i, 1:unity, the same could not be said of Puritanism. The Plymouth Pilgrims
2mo i, 1:had cast off all allegiance to the Anglican Church and established a
2mo i, 1:separate and independent congregation before they came to America. The
2mo i, 1:Puritans, essaying at first the task of reformers within the Church,
2mo i, 1:soon after their arrival in Massachusetts, likewise flung off their yoke
2mo i, 1:of union with the Anglicans. In each town a separate congregation was
2mo i, 1:organized, the male members choosing the pastor, the teachers, and the
2mo i, 1:other officers. They also composed the voters in the town meeting, where
2mo i, 1:secular matters were determined. The union of church and government was
2mo i, 1:thus complete, and uniformity of faith and life prescribed by law and
2mo i, 1:enforced by civil authorities; but this worked for local autonomy
2mo i, 1:instead of imperial unity.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The clergy became a powerful class, dominant through their learning and
2mo i, 1:their fearful denunciations of the faithless. They wrote the books for
2mo i, 1:the people to read--the famous Cotton Mather having three hundred and
2mo i, 1:eighty-three books and pamphlets to his credit. In cooperation with the
2mo i, 1:civil officers they enforced a strict observance of the Puritan
2mo i, 1:Sabbath--a day of rest that began at six o'clock on Saturday evening and
2mo i, 1:lasted until sunset on Sunday. All work, all trading, all amusement, and
2mo i, 1:all worldly conversation were absolutely prohibited during those hours.
2mo i, 1:A thoughtless maid servant who for some earthly reason smiled in church
2mo i, 1:was in danger of being banished as a vagabond. Robert Pike, a devout
2mo i, 1:Puritan, thinking the sun had gone to rest, ventured forth on horseback
2mo i, 1:one Sunday evening and was luckless enough to have a ray of light strike
2mo i, 1:him through a rift in the clouds. The next day he was brought into court
2mo i, 1:and fined for "his ungodly conduct." With persons accused of witchcraft
2mo i, 1:the Puritans were still more ruthless. When a mania of persecution swept
2mo i, 1:over Massachusetts in 1692, eighteen people were hanged, one was pressed
2mo i, 1:to death, many suffered imprisonment, and two died in jail.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Just about this time, however, there came a break in the uniformity of
2mo i, 1:Puritan rule. The crown and church in England had long looked upon it
2mo i, 1:with disfavor, and in 1684 King Charles II annulled the old charter of
2mo i, 1:the Massachusetts Bay Company. A new document issued seven years later
2mo i, 1:wrested from the Puritans of the colony the right to elect their own
2mo i, 1:governor and reserved the power of appointment to the king. It also
2mo i, 1:abolished the rule limiting the suffrage to church members, substituting
2mo i, 1:for it a simple property qualification. Thus a royal governor and an
2mo i, 1:official family, certain to be Episcopalian in faith and monarchist in
2mo i, 1:sympathies, were forced upon Massachusetts; and members of all religious
2mo i, 1:denominations, if they had the required amount of property, were
2mo i, 1:permitted to take part in elections. By this act in the name of the
2mo i, 1:crown, the Puritan monopoly was broken down in Massachusetts, and that
2mo i, 1:province was brought into line with Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New
2mo i, 1:Hampshire, where property, not religious faith, was the test for the
2mo i, 1:suffrage.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Growth of Religious Toleration.=--Though neither the Anglicans of
2mo i, 1:Virginia nor the Puritans of Massachusetts believed in toleration for
2mo i, 1:other denominations, that principle was strictly applied in Rhode
2mo i, 1:Island. There, under the leadership of Roger Williams, liberty in
2mo i, 1:matters of conscience was established in the beginning. Maryland, by
2mo i, 1:granting in 1649 freedom to those who professed to believe in Jesus
2mo i, 1:Christ, opened its gates to all Christians; and Pennsylvania, true to
2mo i, 1:the tenets of the Friends, gave freedom of conscience to those "who
2mo i, 1:confess and acknowledge the one Almighty and Eternal God to be the
2mo i, 1:creator, upholder, and ruler of the World." By one circumstance or
2mo i, 1:another, the Middle colonies were thus early characterized by diversity
2mo i, 1:rather than uniformity of opinion. Dutch Protestants, Huguenots,
2mo i, 1:Quakers, Baptists, Presbyterians, New Lights, Moravians, Lutherans,
2mo i, 1:Catholics, and other denominations became too strongly intrenched and
2mo i, 1:too widely scattered to permit any one of them to rule, if it had
2mo i, 1:desired to do so. There were communities and indeed whole sections where
2mo i, 1:one or another church prevailed, but in no colony was a legislature
2mo i, 1:steadily controlled by a single group. Toleration encouraged diversity,
2mo i, 1:and diversity, in turn, worked for greater toleration.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The government and faith of the dissenting denominations conspired with
2mo i, 1:economic and political tendencies to draw America away from the English
2mo i, 1:state. Presbyterians, Quakers, Baptists, and Puritans had no hierarchy
2mo i, 1:of bishops and archbishops to bind them to the seat of power in London.
2mo i, 1:Neither did they look to that metropolis for guidance in interpreting
2mo i, 1:articles of faith. Local self-government in matters ecclesiastical
2mo i, 1:helped to train them for local self-government in matters political. The
2mo i, 1:spirit of independence which led Dissenters to revolt in the Old World,
2mo i, 1:nourished as it was amid favorable circumstances in the New World, made
2mo i, 1:them all the more zealous in the defense of every right against
2mo i, 1:authority imposed from without.

2mo i, 1:SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Religion and Local Schools.=--One of the first cares of each Protestant
2mo i, 1:denomination was the education of the children in the faith. In this
2mo i, 1:work the Bible became the center of interest. The English version was
2mo i, 1:indeed the one book of the people. Farmers, shopkeepers, and artisans,
2mo i, 1:whose life had once been bounded by the daily routine of labor, found in
2mo i, 1:the Scriptures not only an inspiration to religious conduct, but also a
2mo i, 1:book of romance, travel, and history. "Legend and annal," says John
2mo i, 1:Richard Green, "war-song and psalm, state-roll and biography, the mighty
2mo i, 1:voices of prophets, the parables of Evangelists, stories of mission
2mo i, 1:journeys, of perils by sea and among the heathen, philosophic arguments,
2mo i, 1:apocalyptic visions, all were flung broadcast over minds unoccupied for
2mo i, 1:the most part by any rival learning.... As a mere literary monument, the
2mo i, 1:English version of the Bible remains the noblest example of the English
2mo i, 1:tongue." It was the King James version just from the press that the
2mo i, 1:Pilgrims brought across the sea with them.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:For the authority of the Established Church was substituted the
2mo i, 1:authority of the Scriptures. The Puritans devised a catechism based upon
2mo i, 1:their interpretation of the Bible, and, very soon after their arrival in
2mo i, 1:America, they ordered all parents and masters of servants to be diligent
2mo i, 1:in seeing that their children and wards were taught to read religious
2mo i, 1:works and give answers to the religious questions. Massachusetts was
2mo i, 1:scarcely twenty years old before education of this character was
2mo i, 1:declared to be compulsory, and provision was made for public schools
2mo i, 1:where those not taught at home could receive instruction in reading and
2mo i, 1:writing.

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Outside of New England the idea of compulsory education was not regarded
2mo i, 1:with the same favor; but the whole land was nevertheless dotted with
2mo i, 1:little schools kept by "dames, itinerant teachers, or local parsons."
2mo i, 1:Whether we turn to the life of Franklin in the North or Washington in
2mo i, 1:the South, we read of tiny schoolhouses, where boys, and sometimes
2mo i, 1:girls, were taught to read and write. Where there were no schools,
2mo i, 1:fathers and mothers of the better kind gave their children the rudiments
2mo i, 1:of learning. Though illiteracy was widespread, there is evidence to show
2mo i, 1:that the diffusion of knowledge among the masses was making steady
2mo i, 1:progress all through the eighteenth century.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Religion and Higher Learning.=--Religious motives entered into the
2mo i, 1:establishment of colleges as well as local schools. Harvard, founded in
2mo i, 1:1636, and Yale, opened in 1718, were intended primarily to train
2mo i, 1:"learned and godly ministers" for the Puritan churches of New England.
2mo i, 1:To the far North, Dartmouth, chartered in 1769, was designed first as a
2mo i, 1:mission to the Indians and then as a college for the sons of New England
2mo i, 1:farmers preparing to preach, teach, or practice law. The College of New
2mo i, 1:Jersey, organized in 1746 and removed to Princeton eleven years later,
2mo i, 1:was sustained by the Presbyterians. Two colleges looked to the
2mo i, 1:Established Church as their source of inspiration and support: William
2mo i, 1:and Mary, founded in Virginia in 1693, and King's College, now Columbia
2mo i, 1:University, chartered by King George II in 1754, on an appeal from the
2mo i, 1:New York Anglicans, alarmed at the growth of religious dissent and the
2mo i, 1:"republican tendencies" of the age. Two colleges revealed a drift away
2mo i, 1:from sectarianism. Brown, established in Rhode Island in 1764, and the
2mo i, 1:Philadelphia Academy, forerunner of the University of Pennsylvania,
2mo i, 1:organized by Benjamin Franklin, reflected the spirit of toleration by
2mo i, 1:giving representation on the board of trustees to several religious
2mo i, 1:sects. It was Franklin's idea that his college should prepare young men
2mo i, 1:to serve in public office as leaders of the people and ornaments to
2mo i, 1:their country.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Self-education in America.=--Important as were these institutions of
2mo i, 1:learning, higher education was by no means confined within their walls.
2mo i, 1:Many well-to-do families sent their sons to Oxford or Cambridge in
2mo i, 1:England. Private tutoring in the home was common. In still more families
2mo i, 1:there were intelligent children who grew up in the great colonial school
2mo i, 1:of adversity and who trained themselves until, in every contest of mind
2mo i, 1:and wit, they could vie with the sons of Harvard or William and Mary or
2mo i, 1:any other college. Such, for example, was Benjamin Franklin, whose
2mo i, 1:charming autobiography, in addition to being an American classic, is a
2mo i, 1:fine record of self-education. His formal training in the classroom was
2mo i, 1:limited to a few years at a local school in Boston; but his
2mo i, 1:self-education continued throughout his life. He early manifested a zeal
2mo i, 1:for reading, and devoured, he tells us, his father's dry library on
2mo i, 1:theology, Bunyan's works, Defoe's writings, Plutarch's _Lives_, Locke's
2mo i, 1:_On the Human Understanding_, and innumerable volumes dealing with
2mo i, 1:secular subjects. His literary style, perhaps the best of his time,
2mo i, 1:Franklin acquired by the diligent and repeated analysis of the
2mo i, 1:_Spectator_. In a life crowded with labors, he found time to read widely
2mo i, 1:in natural science and to win single-handed recognition at the hands of
2mo i, 1:European savants for his discoveries in electricity. By his own efforts
2mo i, 1:he "attained an acquaintance" with Latin, Italian, French, and Spanish,
2mo i, 1:thus unconsciously preparing himself for the day when he was to speak
2mo i, 1:for all America at the court of the king of France.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Lesser lights than Franklin, educated by the same process, were found
2mo i, 1:all over colonial America. From this fruitful source of native ability,
2mo i, 1:self-educated, the American cause drew great strength in the trials of
2mo i, 1:the Revolution.

2mo i, 1:THE COLONIAL PRESS
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Rise of the Newspaper.=--The evolution of American democracy into a
2mo i, 1:government by public opinion, enlightened by the open discussion of
2mo i, 1:political questions, was in no small measure aided by a free press. That
2mo i, 1:too, like education, was a matter of slow growth. A printing press was
2mo i, 1:brought to Massachusetts in 1639, but it was put in charge of an
2mo i, 1:official censor and limited to the publication of religious works. Forty
2mo i, 1:years elapsed before the first newspaper appeared, bearing the curious
2mo i, 1:title, _Public Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestic_, and it had not
2mo i, 1:been running very long before the government of Massachusetts suppressed
2mo i, 1:it for discussing a political question.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Publishing, indeed, seemed to be a precarious business; but in 1704
2mo i, 1:there came a second venture in journalism, _The Boston News-Letter_,
2mo i, 1:which proved to be a more lasting enterprise because it refrained from
2mo i, 1:criticizing the authorities. Still the public interest languished. When
2mo i, 1:Franklin's brother, James, began to issue his _New England Courant_
2mo i, 1:about 1720, his friends sought to dissuade him, saying that one
2mo i, 1:newspaper was enough for America. Nevertheless he continued it; and his
2mo i, 1:confidence in the future was rewarded. In nearly every colony a gazette
2mo i, 1:or chronicle appeared within the next thirty years or more. Benjamin
2mo i, 1:Franklin was able to record in 1771 that America had twenty-five
2mo i, 1:newspapers. Boston led with five. Philadelphia had three: two in English
2mo i, 1:and one in German.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Censorship and Restraints on the Press.=--The idea of printing,
2mo i, 1:unlicensed by the government and uncontrolled by the church, was,
2mo i, 1:however, slow in taking form. The founders of the American colonies had
2mo i, 1:never known what it was to have the free and open publication of books,
2mo i, 1:pamphlets, broadsides, and newspapers. When the art of printing was
2mo i, 1:first discovered, the control of publishing was vested in clerical
2mo i, 1:authorities. After the establishment of the State Church in England in
2mo i, 1:the reign of Elizabeth, censorship of the press became a part of royal
2mo i, 1:prerogative. Printing was restricted to Oxford, Cambridge, and London;
2mo i, 1:and no one could publish anything without previous approval of the
2mo i, 1:official censor. When the Puritans were in power, the popular party,
2mo i, 1:with a zeal which rivaled that of the crown, sought, in turn, to silence
2mo i, 1:royalist and clerical writers by a vigorous censorship. After the
2mo i, 1:restoration of the monarchy, control of the press was once more placed
2mo i, 1:in royal hands, where it remained until 1695, when Parliament, by
2mo i, 1:failing to renew the licensing act, did away entirely with the official
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:censorship. By that time political parties were so powerful and so
2mo i, 1:active and printing presses were so numerous that official review of all
2mo i, 1:published matter became a sheer impossibility.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In America, likewise, some troublesome questions arose in connection
2mo i, 1:with freedom of the press. The Puritans of Massachusetts were no less
2mo i, 1:anxious than King Charles or the Archbishop of London to shut out from
2mo i, 1:the prying eyes of the people all literature "not mete for them to
2mo i, 1:read"; and so they established a system of official licensing for
2mo i, 1:presses, which lasted until 1755. In the other colonies where there was
2mo i, 1:more diversity of opinion and publishers could set up in business with
2mo i, 1:impunity, they were nevertheless constantly liable to arrest for
2mo i, 1:printing anything displeasing to the colonial governments. In 1721 the
2mo i, 1:editor of the _Mercury_ in Philadelphia was called before the
2mo i, 1:proprietary council and ordered to apologize for a political article,
2mo i, 1:and for a later offense of a similar character he was thrown into jail.
2mo i, 1:A still more famous case was that of Peter Zenger, a New York publisher,
2mo i, 1:who was arrested in 1735 for criticising the administration. Lawyers who
2mo i, 1:ventured to defend the unlucky editor were deprived of their licenses to
2mo i, 1:practice, and it became necessary to bring an attorney all the way from
2mo i, 1:Philadelphia. By this time the tension of feeling was high, and the
2mo i, 1:approbation of the public was forthcoming when the lawyer for the
2mo i, 1:defense exclaimed to the jury that the very cause of liberty itself, not
2mo i, 1:that of the poor printer, was on trial! The verdict for Zenger, when it
2mo i, 1:finally came, was the signal for an outburst of popular rejoicing.
2mo i, 1:Already the people of King George's province knew how precious a thing
2mo i, 1:is the freedom of the press.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Thanks to the schools, few and scattered as they were, and to the
2mo i, 1:vigilance of parents, a very large portion, perhaps nearly one-half, of
2mo i, 1:the colonists could read. Through the newspapers, pamphlets, and
2mo i, 1:almanacs that streamed from the types, the people could follow the
2mo i, 1:course of public events and grasp the significance of political
2mo i, 1:arguments. An American opinion was in the process of making--an
2mo i, 1:independent opinion nourished by the press and enriched by discussions
2mo i, 1:around the fireside and at the taverns. When the day of resistance to
2mo i, 1:British rule came, government by opinion was at hand. For every person
2mo i, 1:who could hear the voice of Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams, there were a
2mo i, 1:thousand who could see their appeals on the printed page. Men who had
2mo i, 1:spelled out their letters while poring over Franklin's _Poor Richard's
2mo i, 1:Almanac_ lived to read Thomas Paine's thrilling call to arms.

2mo i, 1:THE EVOLUTION IN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Two very distinct lines of development appeared in colonial politics.
2mo i, 1:The one, exalting royal rights and aristocratic privileges, was the
2mo i, 1:drift toward provincial government through royal officers appointed in
2mo i, 1:England. The other, leading toward democracy and self-government, was
2mo i, 1:the growth in the power of the popular legislative assembly. Each
2mo i, 1:movement gave impetus to the other, with increasing force during the
2mo i, 1:passing years, until at last the final collision between the two ideals
2mo i, 1:of government came in the war of independence.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Royal Provinces.=--Of the thirteen English colonies eight were
2mo i, 1:royal provinces in 1776, with governors appointed by the king. Virginia
2mo i, 1:passed under the direct rule of the crown in 1624, when the charter of
2mo i, 1:the London Company was annulled. The Massachusetts Bay corporation lost
2mo i, 1:its charter in 1684, and the new instrument granted seven years later
2mo i, 1:stripped the colonists of the right to choose their chief executive. In
2mo i, 1:the early decades of the eighteenth century both the Carolinas were
2mo i, 1:given the provincial instead of the proprietary form. New Hampshire,
2mo i, 1:severed from Massachusetts in 1679, and Georgia, surrendered by the
2mo i, 1:trustees in 1752, went into the hands of the crown. New York,
2mo i, 1:transferred to the Duke of York on its capture from the Dutch in 1664,
2mo i, 1:became a province when he took the title of James II in 1685. New
2mo i, 1:Jersey, after remaining for nearly forty years under proprietors, was
2mo i, 1:brought directly under the king in 1702. Maryland, Pennsylvania, and
2mo i, 1:Delaware, although they retained their proprietary character until the
2mo i, 1:Revolution, were in some respects like the royal colonies, for their
2mo i, 1:governors were as independent of popular choice as were the appointees
2mo i, 1:of King George. Only two colonies, Rhode Island and Connecticut,
2mo i, 1:retained full self-government on the eve of the Revolution. They alone
2mo i, 1:had governors and legislatures entirely of their own choosing.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The chief officer of the royal province was the governor, who enjoyed
2mo i, 1:high and important powers which he naturally sought to augment at every
2mo i, 1:turn. He enforced the laws and, usually with the consent of a council,
2mo i, 1:appointed the civil and military officers. He granted pardons and
2mo i, 1:reprieves; he was head of the highest court; he was commander-in-chief
2mo i, 1:of the militia; he levied troops for defense and enforced martial law in
2mo i, 1:time of invasion, war, and rebellion. In all the provinces, except
2mo i, 1:Massachusetts, he named the councilors who composed the upper house of
2mo i, 1:the legislature and was likely to choose those who favored his claims.
2mo i, 1:He summoned, adjourned, and dissolved the popular assembly, or the lower
2mo i, 1:house; he laid before it the projects of law desired by the crown; and
2mo i, 1:he vetoed measures which he thought objectionable. Here were in America
2mo i, 1:all the elements of royal prerogative against which Hampden had
2mo i, 1:protested and Cromwell had battled in England.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: THE ROYAL GOVERNOR'S PALACE AT NEW BERNE]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The colonial governors were generally surrounded by a body of
2mo i, 1:office-seekers and hunters for land grants. Some of them were noblemen
2mo i, 1:of broken estates who had come to America to improve their fortunes. The
2mo i, 1:pretensions of this circle grated on colonial nerves, and privileges
2mo i, 1:granted to them, often at the expense of colonists, did much to deepen
2mo i, 1:popular antipathy to the British government. Favors extended to
2mo i, 1:adherents of the Established Church displeased Dissenters. The
2mo i, 1:reappearance of this formidable union of church and state, from which
2mo i, 1:they had fled, stirred anew the ancient wrath against that combination.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Colonial Assembly.=--Coincident with the drift toward
2mo i, 1:administration through royal governors was the second and opposite
2mo i, 1:tendency, namely, a steady growth in the practice of self-government.
2mo i, 1:The voters of England had long been accustomed to share in taxation and
2mo i, 1:law-making through representatives in Parliament, and the idea was early
2mo i, 1:introduced in America. Virginia was only twelve years old (1619) when
2mo i, 1:its first representative assembly appeared. As the towns of
2mo i, 1:Massachusetts multiplied and it became impossible for all the members of
2mo i, 1:the corporation to meet at one place, the representative idea was
2mo i, 1:adopted, in 1633. The river towns of Connecticut formed a representative
2mo i, 1:system under their "Fundamental Orders" of 1639, and the entire colony
2mo i, 1:was given a royal charter in 1662. Generosity, as well as practical
2mo i, 1:considerations, induced such proprietors as Lord Baltimore and William
2mo i, 1:Penn to invite their colonists to share in the government as soon as any
2mo i, 1:considerable settlements were made. Thus by one process or another every
2mo i, 1:one of the colonies secured a popular assembly.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It is true that in the provision for popular elections, the suffrage was
2mo i, 1:finally restricted to property owners or taxpayers, with a leaning
2mo i, 1:toward the freehold qualification. In Virginia, the rural voter had to
2mo i, 1:be a freeholder owning at least fifty acres of land, if there was no
2mo i, 1:house on it, or twenty-five acres with a house twenty-five feet square.
2mo i, 1:In Massachusetts, the voter for member of the assembly under the charter
2mo i, 1:of 1691 had to be a freeholder of an estate worth forty shillings a year
2mo i, 1:at least or of other property to the value of forty pounds sterling. In
2mo i, 1:Pennsylvania, the suffrage was granted to freeholders owning fifty acres
2mo i, 1:or more of land well seated, twelve acres cleared, and to other persons
2mo i, 1:worth at least fifty pounds in lawful money.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Restrictions like these undoubtedly excluded from the suffrage a very
2mo i, 1:considerable number of men, particularly the mechanics and artisans of
2mo i, 1:the towns, who were by no means content with their position.
2mo i, 1:Nevertheless, it was relatively easy for any man to acquire a small
2mo i, 1:freehold, so cheap and abundant was land; and in fact a large proportion
2mo i, 1:of the colonists were land owners. Thus the assemblies, in spite of the
2mo i, 1:limited suffrage, acquired a democratic tone.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The popular character of the assemblies increased as they became engaged
2mo i, 1:in battles with the royal and proprietary governors. When called upon by
2mo i, 1:the executive to make provision for the support of the administration,
2mo i, 1:the legislature took advantage of the opportunity to make terms in the
2mo i, 1:interest of the taxpayers. It made annual, not permanent, grants of
2mo i, 1:money to pay official salaries and then insisted upon electing a
2mo i, 1:treasurer to dole it out. Thus the colonists learned some of the
2mo i, 1:mysteries of public finance, as well as the management of rapacious
2mo i, 1:officials. The legislature also used its power over money grants to
2mo i, 1:force the governor to sign bills which he would otherwise have vetoed.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Contests between Legislatures and Governors.=--As may be imagined, many
2mo i, 1:and bitter were the contests between the royal and proprietary governors
2mo i, 1:and the colonial assemblies. Franklin relates an amusing story of how
2mo i, 1:the Pennsylvania assembly held in one hand a bill for the executive to
2mo i, 1:sign and, in the other hand, the money to pay his salary. Then, with sly
2mo i, 1:humor, Franklin adds: "Do not, my courteous reader, take pet at our
2mo i, 1:proprietary constitution for these our bargain and sale proceedings in
2mo i, 1:legislation. It is a happy country where justice and what was your own
2mo i, 1:before can be had for ready money. It is another addition to the value
2mo i, 1:of money and of course another spur to industry. Every land is not so
2mo i, 1:blessed."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It must not be thought, however, that every governor got off as easily
2mo i, 1:as Franklin's tale implies. On the contrary, the legislatures, like
2mo i, 1:Caesar, fed upon meat that made them great and steadily encroached upon
2mo i, 1:executive prerogatives as they tried out and found their strength. If
2mo i, 1:we may believe contemporary laments, the power of the crown in America
2mo i, 1:was diminishing when it was struck down altogether. In New York, the
2mo i, 1:friends of the governor complained in 1747 that "the inhabitants of
2mo i, 1:plantations are generally educated in republican principles; upon
2mo i, 1:republican principles all is conducted. Little more than a shadow of
2mo i, 1:royal authority remains in the Northern colonies." "Here," echoed the
2mo i, 1:governor of South Carolina, the following year, "levelling principles
2mo i, 1:prevail; the frame of the civil government is unhinged; a governor, if
2mo i, 1:he would be idolized, must betray his trust; the people have got their
2mo i, 1:whole administration in their hands; the election of the members of the
2mo i, 1:assembly is by ballot; not civil posts only, but all ecclesiastical
2mo i, 1:preferments, are in the disposal or election of the people."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Though baffled by the "levelling principles" of the colonial assemblies,
2mo i, 1:the governors did not give up the case as hopeless. Instead they evolved
2mo i, 1:a system of policy and action which they thought could bring the
2mo i, 1:obstinate provincials to terms. That system, traceable in their letters
2mo i, 1:to the government in London, consisted of three parts: (1) the royal
2mo i, 1:officers in the colonies were to be made independent of the legislatures
2mo i, 1:by taxes imposed by acts of Parliament; (2) a British standing army was
2mo i, 1:to be maintained in America; (3) the remaining colonial charters were to
2mo i, 1:be revoked and government by direct royal authority was to be enlarged.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Such a system seemed plausible enough to King George III and to many
2mo i, 1:ministers of the crown in London. With governors, courts, and an army
2mo i, 1:independent of the colonists, they imagined it would be easy to carry
2mo i, 1:out both royal orders and acts of Parliament. This reasoning seemed both
2mo i, 1:practical and logical. Nor was it founded on theory, for it came fresh
2mo i, 1:from the governors themselves. It was wanting in one respect only. It
2mo i, 1:failed to take account of the fact that the American people were growing
2mo i, 1:strong in the practice of self-government and could dispense with the
2mo i, 1:tutelage of the British ministry, no matter how excellent it might be or
2mo i, 1:how benevolent its intentions.

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE DEVELOPMENT OF COLONIAL NATIONALISM
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It is one of the well-known facts of history that a people loosely
2mo i, 1:united by domestic ties of a political and economic nature, even a
2mo i, 1:people torn by domestic strife, may be welded into a solid and compact
2mo i, 1:body by an attack from a foreign power. The imperative call to common
2mo i, 1:defense, the habit of sharing common burdens, the fusing force of common
2mo i, 1:service--these things, induced by the necessity of resisting outside
2mo i, 1:interference, act as an amalgam drawing together all elements, except,
2mo i, 1:perhaps, the most discordant. The presence of the enemy allays the most
2mo i, 1:virulent of quarrels, temporarily at least. "Politics," runs an old
2mo i, 1:saying, "stops at the water's edge."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:This ancient political principle, so well understood in diplomatic
2mo i, 1:circles, applied nearly as well to the original thirteen American
2mo i, 1:colonies as to the countries of Europe. The necessity for common
2mo i, 1:defense, if not equally great, was certainly always pressing. Though it
2mo i, 1:has long been the practice to speak of the early settlements as founded
2mo i, 1:in "a wilderness," this was not actually the case. From the earliest
2mo i, 1:days of Jamestown on through the years, the American people were
2mo i, 1:confronted by dangers from without. All about their tiny settlements
2mo i, 1:were Indians, growing more and more hostile as the frontier advanced and
2mo i, 1:as sharp conflicts over land aroused angry passions. To the south and
2mo i, 1:west was the power of Spain, humiliated, it is true, by the disaster to
2mo i, 1:the Armada, but still presenting an imposing front to the British
2mo i, 1:empire. To the north and west were the French, ambitious, energetic,
2mo i, 1:imperial in temper, and prepared to contest on land and water the
2mo i, 1:advance of British dominion in America.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:RELATIONS WITH THE INDIANS AND THE FRENCH
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Indian Affairs.=--It is difficult to make general statements about the
2mo i, 1:relations of the colonists to the Indians. The problem was presented in
2mo i, 1:different shape in different sections of America. It was not handled
2mo i, 1:according to any coherent or uniform plan by the British government,
2mo i, 1:which alone could speak for all the provinces at the same time. Neither
2mo i, 1:did the proprietors and the governors who succeeded one another, in an
2mo i, 1:irregular train, have the consistent policy or the matured experience
2mo i, 1:necessary for dealing wisely with Indian matters. As the difficulties
2mo i, 1:arose mainly on the frontiers, where the restless and pushing pioneers
2mo i, 1:were making their way with gun and ax, nearly everything that happened
2mo i, 1:was the result of chance rather than of calculation. A personal quarrel
2mo i, 1:between traders and an Indian, a jug of whisky, a keg of gunpowder, the
2mo i, 1:exchange of guns for furs, personal treachery, or a flash of bad temper
2mo i, 1:often set in motion destructive forces of the most terrible character.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:On one side of the ledger may be set innumerable generous records--of
2mo i, 1:Squanto and Samoset teaching the Pilgrims the ways of the wilds; of
2mo i, 1:Roger Williams buying his lands from the friendly natives; or of William
2mo i, 1:Penn treating with them on his arrival in America. On the other side of
2mo i, 1:the ledger must be recorded many a cruel and bloody conflict as the
2mo i, 1:frontier rolled westward with deadly precision. The Pequots on the
2mo i, 1:Connecticut border, sensing their doom, fell upon the tiny settlements
2mo i, 1:with awful fury in 1637 only to meet with equally terrible punishment. A
2mo i, 1:generation later, King Philip, son of Massasoit, the friend of the
2mo i, 1:Pilgrims, called his tribesmen to a war of extermination which brought
2mo i, 1:the strength of all New England to the field and ended in his own
2mo i, 1:destruction. In New York, the relations with the Indians, especially
2mo i, 1:with the Algonquins and the Mohawks, were marked by periodic and
2mo i, 1:desperate wars. Virginia and her Southern neighbors suffered as did New
2mo i, 1:England. In 1622 Opecacano, a brother of Powhatan, the friend of the
2mo i, 1:Jamestown settlers, launched a general massacre; and in 1644 he
2mo i, 1:attempted a war of extermination. In 1675 the whole frontier was ablaze.
2mo i, 1:Nathaniel Bacon vainly attempted to stir the colonial governor to put up
2mo i, 1:an adequate defense and, failing in that plea, himself headed a revolt
2mo i, 1:and a successful expedition against the Indians. As the Virginia
2mo i, 1:outposts advanced into the Kentucky country, the strife with the natives
2mo i, 1:was transferred to that "dark and bloody ground"; while to the
2mo i, 1:southeast, a desperate struggle with the Tuscaroras called forth the
2mo i, 1:combined forces of the two Carolinas and Virginia.

2mo i, 1:From such horrors New Jersey and Delaware were saved on account of their
2mo i, 1:geographical location. Pennsylvania, consistently following a policy of
2mo i, 1:conciliation, was likewise spared until her western vanguard came into
2mo i, 1:full conflict with the allied French and Indians. Georgia, by clever
2mo i, 1:negotiations and treaties of alliance, managed to keep on fair terms
2mo i, 1:with her belligerent Cherokees and Creeks. But neither diplomacy nor
2mo i, 1:generosity could stay the inevitable conflict as the frontier advanced,
2mo i, 1:especially after the French soldiers enlisted the Indians in their
2mo i, 1:imperial enterprises. It was then that desultory fighting became general
2mo i, 1:warfare.

2mo i, 1:1750]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Early Relations with the French.=--During the first decades of French
2mo i, 1:exploration and settlement in the St. Lawrence country, the English
2mo i, 1:colonies, engrossed with their own problems, gave little or no thought
2mo i, 1:to their distant neighbors. Quebec, founded in 1608, and Montreal, in
2mo i, 1:1642, were too far away, too small in population, and too slight in
2mo i, 1:strength to be much of a menace to Boston, Hartford, or New York. It was
2mo i, 1:the statesmen in France and England, rather than the colonists in
2mo i, 1:America, who first grasped the significance of the slowly converging
2mo i, 1:empires in North America. It was the ambition of Louis XIV of France,
2mo i, 1:rather than the labors of Jesuit missionaries and French rangers, that
2mo i, 1:sounded the first note of colonial alarm.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Evidence of this lies in the fact that three conflicts between the
2mo i, 1:English and the French occurred before their advancing frontiers met on
2mo i, 1:the Pennsylvania border. King William's War (1689-1697), Queen Anne's
2mo i, 1:War (1701-1713), and King George's War (1744-1748) owed their origins
2mo i, 1:and their endings mainly to the intrigues and rivalries of European
2mo i, 1:powers, although they all involved the American colonies in struggles
2mo i, 1:with the French and their savage allies.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Clash in the Ohio Valley.=--The second of these wars had hardly
2mo i, 1:closed, however, before the English colonists themselves began to be
2mo i, 1:seriously alarmed about the rapidly expanding French dominion in the
2mo i, 1:West. Marquette and Joliet, who opened the Lake region, and La Salle,
2mo i, 1:who in 1682 had gone down the Mississippi to the Gulf, had been followed
2mo i, 1:by the builders of forts. In 1718, the French founded New Orleans, thus
2mo i, 1:taking possession of the gateway to the Mississippi as well as the St.
2mo i, 1:Lawrence. A few years later they built Fort Niagara; in 1731 they
2mo i, 1:occupied Crown Point; in 1749 they formally announced their dominion
2mo i, 1:over all the territory drained by the Ohio River. Having asserted this
2mo i, 1:lofty claim, they set out to make it good by constructing in the years
2mo i, 1:1752-1754 Fort Le Boeuf near Lake Erie, Fort Venango on the upper
2mo i, 1:waters of the Allegheny, and Fort Duquesne at the junction of the
2mo i, 1:streams forming the Ohio. Though they were warned by George Washington,
2mo i, 1:in the name of the governor of Virginia, to keep out of territory "so
2mo i, 1:notoriously known to be property of the crown of Great Britain," the
2mo i, 1:French showed no signs of relinquishing their pretensions.

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Final Phase--the French and Indian War.=--Thus it happened that the
2mo i, 1:shot which opened the Seven Years' War, known in America as the French
2mo i, 1:and Indian War, was fired in the wilds of Pennsylvania. There began the
2mo i, 1:conflict that spread to Europe and even Asia and finally involved
2mo i, 1:England and Prussia, on the one side, and France, Austria, Spain, and
2mo i, 1:minor powers on the other. On American soil, the defeat of Braddock in
2mo i, 1:1755 and Wolfe's exploit in capturing Quebec four years later were the
2mo i, 1:dramatic features. On the continent of Europe, England subsidized
2mo i, 1:Prussian arms to hold France at bay. In India, on the banks of the
2mo i, 1:Ganges, as on the banks of the St. Lawrence, British arms were
2mo i, 1:triumphant. Well could the historian write: "Conquests equaling in
2mo i, 1:rapidity and far surpassing in magnitude those of Cortes and Pizarro had
2mo i, 1:been achieved in the East." Well could the merchants of London declare
2mo i, 1:that under the administration of William Pitt, the imperial genius of
2mo i, 1:this world-wide conflict, commerce had been "united with and made to
2mo i, 1:flourish by war."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:From the point of view of the British empire, the results of the war
2mo i, 1:were momentous. By the peace of 1763, Canada and the territory east of
2mo i, 1:the Mississippi, except New Orleans, passed under the British flag. The
2mo i, 1:remainder of the Louisiana territory was transferred to Spain and French
2mo i, 1:imperial ambitions on the American continent were laid to rest. In
2mo i, 1:exchange for Havana, which the British had seized during the war, Spain
2mo i, 1:ceded to King George the colony of Florida. Not without warrant did
2mo i, 1:Macaulay write in after years that Pitt "was the first Englishman of his
2mo i, 1:time; and he had made England the first country in the world."

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE EFFECTS OF WARFARE ON THE COLONIES
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The various wars with the French and the Indians, trivial in detail as
2mo i, 1:they seem to-day, had a profound influence on colonial life and on the
2mo i, 1:destiny of America. Circumstances beyond the control of popular
2mo i, 1:assemblies, jealous of their individual powers, compelled cooperation
2mo i, 1:among them, grudging and stingy no doubt, but still cooperation. The
2mo i, 1:American people, more eager to be busy in their fields or at their
2mo i, 1:trades, were simply forced to raise and support armies, to learn the
2mo i, 1:arts of warfare, and to practice, if in a small theater, the science of
2mo i, 1:statecraft. These forces, all cumulative, drove the colonists, so
2mo i, 1:tenaciously provincial in their habits, in the direction of nationalism.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The New England Confederation.=--It was in their efforts to deal with
2mo i, 1:the problems presented by the Indian and French menace that the
2mo i, 1:Americans took the first steps toward union. Though there were many
2mo i, 1:common ties among the settlers of New England, it required a deadly
2mo i, 1:fear of the Indians to produce in 1643 the New England Confederation,
2mo i, 1:composed of Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven. The
2mo i, 1:colonies so united were bound together in "a firm and perpetual league
2mo i, 1:of friendship and amity for offense and defense, mutual service and
2mo i, 1:succor, upon all just occasions." They made provision for distributing
2mo i, 1:the burdens of wars among the members and provided for a congress of
2mo i, 1:commissioners from each colony to determine upon common policies. For
2mo i, 1:some twenty years the Confederation was active and it continued to hold
2mo i, 1:meetings until after the extinction of the Indian peril on the immediate
2mo i, 1:border.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Virginia, no less than Massachusetts, was aware of the importance of
2mo i, 1:intercolonial cooperation. In the middle of the seventeenth century, the
2mo i, 1:Old Dominion began treaties of commerce and amity with New York and the
2mo i, 1:colonies of New England. In 1684 delegates from Virginia met at Albany
2mo i, 1:with the agents of New York and Massachusetts to discuss problems of
2mo i, 1:mutual defense. A few years later the Old Dominion cooperated loyally
2mo i, 1:with the Carolinas in defending their borders against Indian forays.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Albany Plan of Union.=--An attempt at a general colonial union was
2mo i, 1:made in 1754. On the suggestion of the Lords of Trade in England, a
2mo i, 1:conference was held at Albany to consider Indian relations, to devise
2mo i, 1:measures of defense against the French, and to enter into "articles of
2mo i, 1:union and confederation for the general defense of his Majesty's
2mo i, 1:subjects and interests in North America as well in time of peace as of
2mo i, 1:war." New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York,
2mo i, 1:Pennsylvania, and Maryland were represented. After a long discussion, a
2mo i, 1:plan of union, drafted mainly, it seems, by Benjamin Franklin, was
2mo i, 1:adopted and sent to the colonies and the crown for approval. The
2mo i, 1:colonies, jealous of their individual rights, refused to accept the
2mo i, 1:scheme and the king disapproved it for the reason, Franklin said, that
2mo i, 1:it had "too much weight in the democratic part of the constitution."
2mo i, 1:Though the Albany union failed, the document is still worthy of study
2mo i, 1:because it forecast many of the perplexing problems that were not solved
2mo i, 1:until thirty-three years afterward, when another convention of which
2mo i, 1:also Franklin was a member drafted the Constitution of the United
2mo i, 1:States.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: BENJAMIN FRANKLIN]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Military Education of the Colonists.=--The same wars that showed
2mo i, 1:the provincials the meaning of union likewise instructed them in the art
2mo i, 1:of defending their institutions. Particularly was this true of the last
2mo i, 1:French and Indian conflict, which stretched all the way from Maine to
2mo i, 1:the Carolinas and made heavy calls upon them all for troops. The answer,
2mo i, 1:it is admitted, was far from satisfactory to the British government and
2mo i, 1:the conduct of the militiamen was far from professional; but thousands
2mo i, 1:of Americans got a taste, a strong taste, of actual fighting in the
2mo i, 1:field. Men like George Washington and Daniel Morgan learned lessons that
2mo i, 1:were not forgotten in after years. They saw what American militiamen
2mo i, 1:could do under favorable circumstances and they watched British regulars
2mo i, 1:operating on American soil. "This whole transaction," shrewdly remarked
2mo i, 1:Franklin of Braddock's campaign, "gave us Americans the first suspicion
2mo i, 1:that our exalted ideas of the prowess of British regular troops had not
2mo i, 1:been well founded." It was no mere accident that the Virginia colonel
2mo i, 1:who drew his sword under the elm at Cambridge and took command of the
2mo i, 1:army of the Revolution was the brave officer who had "spurned the
2mo i, 1:whistle of bullets" at the memorable battle in western Pennsylvania.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Financial Burdens and Commercial Disorder.=--While the provincials were
2mo i, 1:learning lessons in warfare they were also paying the bills. All the
2mo i, 1:conflicts were costly in treasure as in blood. King Philip's war left
2mo i, 1:New England weak and almost bankrupt. The French and Indian struggle was
2mo i, 1:especially expensive. The twenty-five thousand men put in the field by
2mo i, 1:the colonies were sustained only by huge outlays of money. Paper
2mo i, 1:currency streamed from the press and debts were accumulated. Commerce
2mo i, 1:was driven from its usual channels and prices were enhanced. When the
2mo i, 1:end came, both England and America were staggering under heavy
2mo i, 1:liabilities, and to make matters worse there was a fall of prices
2mo i, 1:accompanied by a commercial depression which extended over a period of
2mo i, 1:ten years. It was in the midst of this crisis that measures of taxation
2mo i, 1:had to be devised to pay the cost of the war, precipitating the quarrel
2mo i, 1:which led to American independence.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Expulsion of French Power from North America.=--The effects of the
2mo i, 1:defeat administered to France, as time proved, were difficult to
2mo i, 1:estimate. Some British statesmen regarded it as a happy circumstance
2mo i, 1:that the colonists, already restive under their administration, had no
2mo i, 1:foreign power at hand to aid them in case they struck for independence.
2mo i, 1:American leaders, on the other hand, now that the soldiers of King Louis
2mo i, 1:were driven from the continent, thought that they had no other country
2mo i, 1:to fear if they cast off British sovereignty. At all events, France,
2mo i, 1:though defeated, was not out of the sphere of American influence; for,
2mo i, 1:as events proved, it was the fortunate French alliance negotiated by
2mo i, 1:Franklin that assured the triumph of American arms in the War of the
2mo i, 1:Revolution.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:COLONIAL RELATIONS WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:It was neither the Indian wars nor the French wars that finally brought
2mo i, 1:forth American nationality. That was the product of the long strife
2mo i, 1:with the mother country which culminated in union for the war of
2mo i, 1:independence. The forces that created this nation did not operate in the
2mo i, 1:colonies alone. The character of the English sovereigns, the course of
2mo i, 1:events in English domestic politics, and English measures of control
2mo i, 1:over the colonies--executive, legislative, and judicial--must all be
2mo i, 1:taken into account.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Last of the Stuarts.=--The struggles between Charles I (1625-49)
2mo i, 1:and the parliamentary party and the turmoil of the Puritan regime
2mo i, 1:(1649-60) so engrossed the attention of Englishmen at home that they had
2mo i, 1:little time to think of colonial policies or to interfere with colonial
2mo i, 1:affairs. The restoration of the monarchy in 1660, accompanied by
2mo i, 1:internal peace and the increasing power of the mercantile classes in the
2mo i, 1:House of Commons, changed all that. In the reign of Charles II
2mo i, 1:(1660-85), himself an easy-going person, the policy of regulating trade
2mo i, 1:by act of Parliament was developed into a closely knit system and
2mo i, 1:powerful agencies to supervise the colonies were created. At the same
2mo i, 1:time a system of stricter control over the dominions was ushered in by
2mo i, 1:the annulment of the old charter of Massachusetts which conferred so
2mo i, 1:much self-government on the Puritans.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Charles' successor, James II, a man of sterner stuff and jealous of his
2mo i, 1:authority in the colonies as well as at home, continued the policy thus
2mo i, 1:inaugurated and enlarged upon it. If he could have kept his throne, he
2mo i, 1:would have bent the Americans under a harsh rule or brought on in his
2mo i, 1:dominions a revolution like that which he precipitated at home in 1688.
2mo i, 1:He determined to unite the Northern colonies and introduce a more
2mo i, 1:efficient administration based on the pattern of the royal provinces. He
2mo i, 1:made a martinet, Sir Edmund Andros, governor of all New England, New
2mo i, 1:York, and New Jersey. The charter of Massachusetts, annulled in the last
2mo i, 1:days of his brother's reign, he continued to ignore, and that of
2mo i, 1:Connecticut would have been seized if it had not been spirited away and
2mo i, 1:hidden, according to tradition, in a hollow oak.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:For several months, Andros gave the Northern colonies a taste of
2mo i, 1:ill-tempered despotism. He wrung quit rents from land owners not
2mo i, 1:accustomed to feudal dues; he abrogated titles to land where, in his
2mo i, 1:opinion, they were unlawful; he forced the Episcopal service upon the
2mo i, 1:Old South Church in Boston; and he denied the writ of _habeas corpus_ to
2mo i, 1:a preacher who denounced taxation without representation. In the middle
2mo i, 1:of his arbitrary course, however, his hand was stayed. The news came
2mo i, 1:that King James had been dethroned by his angry subjects, and the people
2mo i, 1:of Boston, kindling a fire on Beacon Hill, summoned the countryside to
2mo i, 1:dispose of Andros. The response was prompt and hearty. The hated
2mo i, 1:governor was arrested, imprisoned, and sent back across the sea under
2mo i, 1:guard.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The overthrow of James, followed by the accession of William and Mary
2mo i, 1:and by assured parliamentary supremacy, had an immediate effect in the
2mo i, 1:colonies. The new order was greeted with thanksgiving. Massachusetts was
2mo i, 1:given another charter which, though not so liberal as the first,
2mo i, 1:restored the spirit if not the entire letter of self-government. In the
2mo i, 1:other colonies where Andros had been operating, the old course of
2mo i, 1:affairs was resumed.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Indifference of the First Two Georges.=--On the death in 1714 of
2mo i, 1:Queen Anne, the successor of King William, the throne passed to a
2mo i, 1:Hanoverian prince who, though grateful for English honors and revenues,
2mo i, 1:was more interested in Hanover than in England. George I and George II,
2mo i, 1:whose combined reigns extended from 1714 to 1760, never even learned to
2mo i, 1:speak the English language, at least without an accent. The necessity of
2mo i, 1:taking thought about colonial affairs bored both of them so that the
2mo i, 1:stoutest defender of popular privileges in Boston or Charleston had no
2mo i, 1:ground to complain of the exercise of personal prerogatives by the king.
2mo i, 1:Moreover, during a large part of this period, the direction of affairs
2mo i, 1:was in the hands of an astute leader, Sir Robert Walpole, who betrayed
2mo i, 1:his somewhat cynical view of politics by adopting as his motto: "Let
2mo i, 1:sleeping dogs lie." He revealed his appreciation of popular sentiment
2mo i, 1:by exclaiming: "I will not be the minister to enforce taxes at the
2mo i, 1:expense of blood." Such kings and such ministers were not likely to
2mo i, 1:arouse the slumbering resistance of the thirteen colonies across the
2mo i, 1:sea.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Control of the Crown over the Colonies.=--While no English ruler from
2mo i, 1:James II to George III ventured to interfere with colonial matters
2mo i, 1:personally, constant control over the colonies was exercised by royal
2mo i, 1:officers acting under the authority of the crown. Systematic supervision
2mo i, 1:began in 1660, when there was created by royal order a committee of the
2mo i, 1:king's council to meet on Mondays and Thursdays of each week to consider
2mo i, 1:petitions, memorials, and addresses respecting the plantations. In 1696
2mo i, 1:a regular board was established, known as the "Lords of Trade and
2mo i, 1:Plantations," which continued, until the American Revolution, to
2mo i, 1:scrutinize closely colonial business. The chief duties of the board were
2mo i, 1:to examine acts of colonial legislatures, to recommend measures to those
2mo i, 1:assemblies for adoption, and to hear memorials and petitions from the
2mo i, 1:colonies relative to their affairs.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The methods employed by this board were varied. All laws passed by
2mo i, 1:American legislatures came before it for review as a matter of routine.
2mo i, 1:If it found an act unsatisfactory, it recommended to the king the
2mo i, 1:exercise of his veto power, known as the royal disallowance. Any person
2mo i, 1:who believed his personal or property rights injured by a colonial law
2mo i, 1:could be heard by the board in person or by attorney; in such cases it
2mo i, 1:was the practice to hear at the same time the agent of the colony so
2mo i, 1:involved. The royal veto power over colonial legislation was not,
2mo i, 1:therefore, a formal affair, but was constantly employed on the
2mo i, 1:suggestion of a highly efficient agency of the crown. All this was in
2mo i, 1:addition to the powers exercised by the governors in the royal
2mo i, 1:provinces.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Judicial Control.=--Supplementing this administrative control over the
2mo i, 1:colonies was a constant supervision by the English courts of law. The
2mo i, 1:king, by virtue of his inherent authority, claimed and exercised high
2mo i, 1:appellate powers over all judicial tribunals in the empire. The right
2mo i, 1:of appeal from local courts, expressly set forth in some charters, was,
2mo i, 1:on the eve of the Revolution, maintained in every colony. Any subject in
2mo i, 1:England or America, who, in the regular legal course, was aggrieved by
2mo i, 1:any act of a colonial legislature or any decision of a colonial court,
2mo i, 1:had the right, subject to certain regulations, to carry his case to the
2mo i, 1:king in council, forcing his opponent to follow him across the sea. In
2mo i, 1:the exercise of appellate power, the king in council acting as a court
2mo i, 1:could, and frequently did, declare acts of colonial legislatures duly
2mo i, 1:enacted and approved, null and void, on the ground that they were
2mo i, 1:contrary to English law.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Imperial Control in Operation.=--Day after day, week after week, year
2mo i, 1:after year, the machinery for political and judicial control over
2mo i, 1:colonial affairs was in operation. At one time the British governors in
2mo i, 1:the colonies were ordered not to approve any colonial law imposing a
2mo i, 1:duty on European goods imported in English vessels. Again, when North
2mo i, 1:Carolina laid a tax on peddlers, the council objected to it as
2mo i, 1:"restrictive upon the trade and dispersion of English manufactures
2mo i, 1:throughout the continent." At other times, Indian trade was regulated in
2mo i, 1:the interests of the whole empire or grants of lands by a colonial
2mo i, 1:legislature were set aside. Virginia was forbidden to close her ports to
2mo i, 1:North Carolina lest there should be retaliation.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In short, foreign and intercolonial trade were subjected to a control
2mo i, 1:higher than that of the colony, foreshadowing a day when the
2mo i, 1:Constitution of the United States was to commit to Congress the power to
2mo i, 1:regulate interstate and foreign commerce and commerce with the Indians.
2mo i, 1:A superior judicial power, towering above that of the colonies, as the
2mo i, 1:Supreme Court at Washington now towers above the states, kept the
2mo i, 1:colonial legislatures within the metes and bounds of established law. In
2mo i, 1:the thousands of appeals, memorials, petitions, and complaints, and the
2mo i, 1:rulings and decisions upon them, were written the real history of
2mo i, 1:British imperial control over the American colonies.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:So great was the business before the Lords of Trade that the colonies
2mo i, 1:had to keep skilled agents in London to protect their interests. As
2mo i, 1:common grievances against the operation of this machinery of control
2mo i, 1:arose, there appeared in each colony a considerable body of men, with
2mo i, 1:the merchants in the lead, who chafed at the restraints imposed on their
2mo i, 1:enterprise. Only a powerful blow was needed to weld these bodies into a
2mo i, 1:common mass nourishing the spirit of colonial nationalism. When to the
2mo i, 1:repeated minor irritations were added general and sweeping measures of
2mo i, 1:Parliament applying to every colony, the rebound came in the Revolution.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Parliamentary Control over Colonial Affairs.=--As soon as Parliament
2mo i, 1:gained in power at the expense of the king, it reached out to bring the
2mo i, 1:American colonies under its sway as well. Between the execution of
2mo i, 1:Charles I and the accession of George III, there was enacted an immense
2mo i, 1:body of legislation regulating the shipping, trade, and manufactures of
2mo i, 1:America. All of it, based on the "mercantile" theory then prevalent in
2mo i, 1:all countries of Europe, was designed to control the overseas
2mo i, 1:plantations in such a way as to foster the commercial and business
2mo i, 1:interests of the mother country, where merchants and men of finance had
2mo i, 1:got the upper hand. According to this theory, the colonies of the
2mo i, 1:British empire should be confined to agriculture and the production of
2mo i, 1:raw materials, and forced to buy their manufactured goods of England.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_The Navigation Acts._--In the first rank among these measures of
2mo i, 1:British colonial policy must be placed the navigation laws framed for
2mo i, 1:the purpose of building up the British merchant marine and navy--arms so
2mo i, 1:essential in defending the colonies against the Spanish, Dutch, and
2mo i, 1:French. The beginning of this type of legislation was made in 1651 and
2mo i, 1:it was worked out into a system early in the reign of Charles II
2mo i, 1:(1660-85).
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The Navigation Acts, in effect, gave a monopoly of colonial commerce to
2mo i, 1:British ships. No trade could be carried on between Great Britain and
2mo i, 1:her dominions save in vessels built and manned by British subjects. No
2mo i, 1:European goods could be brought to America save in the ships of the
2mo i, 1:country that produced them or in English ships. These laws, which were
2mo i, 1:almost fatal to Dutch shipping in America, fell with severity upon the
2mo i, 1:colonists, compelling them to pay higher freight rates. The adverse
2mo i, 1:effect, however, was short-lived, for the measures stimulated
2mo i, 1:shipbuilding in the colonies, where the abundance of raw materials gave
2mo i, 1:the master builders of America an advantage over those of the mother
2mo i, 1:country. Thus the colonists in the end profited from the restrictive
2mo i, 1:policy written into the Navigation Acts.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_The Acts against Manufactures._--The second group of laws was
2mo i, 1:deliberately aimed to prevent colonial industries from competing too
2mo i, 1:sharply with those of England. Among the earliest of these measures may
2mo i, 1:be counted the Woolen Act of 1699, forbidding the exportation of woolen
2mo i, 1:goods from the colonies and even the woolen trade between towns and
2mo i, 1:colonies. When Parliament learned, as the result of an inquiry, that New
2mo i, 1:England and New York were making thousands of hats a year and sending
2mo i, 1:large numbers annually to the Southern colonies and to Ireland, Spain,
2mo i, 1:and Portugal, it enacted in 1732 a law declaring that "no hats or felts,
2mo i, 1:dyed or undyed, finished or unfinished" should be "put upon any vessel
2mo i, 1:or laden upon any horse or cart with intent to export to any place
2mo i, 1:whatever." The effect of this measure upon the hat industry was almost
2mo i, 1:ruinous. A few years later a similar blow was given to the iron
2mo i, 1:industry. By an act of 1750, pig and bar iron from the colonies were
2mo i, 1:given free entry to England to encourage the production of the raw
2mo i, 1:material; but at the same time the law provided that "no mill or other
2mo i, 1:engine for slitting or rolling of iron, no plating forge to work with a
2mo i, 1:tilt hammer, and no furnace for making steel" should be built in the
2mo i, 1:colonies. As for those already built, they were declared public
2mo i, 1:nuisances and ordered closed. Thus three important economic interests of
2mo i, 1:the colonists, the woolen, hat, and iron industries, were laid under the
2mo i, 1:ban.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_The Trade Laws._--The third group of restrictive measures passed by the
2mo i, 1:British Parliament related to the sale of colonial produce. An act of
2mo i, 1:1663 required the colonies to export certain articles to Great Britain
2mo i, 1:or to her dominions alone; while sugar, tobacco, and ginger consigned to
2mo i, 1:the continent of Europe had to pass through a British port paying custom
2mo i, 1:duties and through a British merchant's hands paying the usual
2mo i, 1:commission. At first tobacco was the only one of the "enumerated
2mo i, 1:articles" which seriously concerned the American colonies, the rest
2mo i, 1:coming mainly from the British West Indies. In the course of time,
2mo i, 1:however, other commodities were added to the list of enumerated
2mo i, 1:articles, until by 1764 it embraced rice, naval stores, copper, furs,
2mo i, 1:hides, iron, lumber, and pearl ashes. This was not all. The colonies
2mo i, 1:were compelled to bring their European purchases back through English
2mo i, 1:ports, paying duties to the government and commissions to merchants
2mo i, 1:again.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_The Molasses Act._--Not content with laws enacted in the interest of
2mo i, 1:English merchants and manufacturers, Parliament sought to protect the
2mo i, 1:British West Indies against competition from their French and Dutch
2mo i, 1:neighbors. New England merchants had long carried on a lucrative trade
2mo i, 1:with the French islands in the West Indies and Dutch Guiana, where sugar
2mo i, 1:and molasses could be obtained in large quantities at low prices. Acting
2mo i, 1:on the protests of English planters in the Barbadoes and Jamaica,
2mo i, 1:Parliament, in 1733, passed the famous Molasses Act imposing duties on
2mo i, 1:sugar and molasses imported into the colonies from foreign
2mo i, 1:countries--rates which would have destroyed the American trade with the
2mo i, 1:French and Dutch if the law had been enforced. The duties, however, were
2mo i, 1:not collected. The molasses and sugar trade with the foreigners went on
2mo i, 1:merrily, smuggling taking the place of lawful traffic.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Effect of the Laws in America.=--As compared with the strict monopoly
2mo i, 1:of her colonial trade which Spain consistently sought to maintain, the
2mo i, 1:policy of England was both moderate and liberal. Furthermore, the
2mo i, 1:restrictive laws were supplemented by many measures intended to be
2mo i, 1:favorable to colonial prosperity. The Navigation Acts, for example,
2mo i, 1:redounded to the advantage of American shipbuilders and the producers
2mo i, 1:of hemp, tar, lumber, and ship stores in general. Favors in British
2mo i, 1:ports were granted to colonial producers as against foreign competitors
2mo i, 1:and in some instances bounties were paid by England to encourage
2mo i, 1:colonial enterprise. Taken all in all, there is much justification in
2mo i, 1:the argument advanced by some modern scholars to the effect that the
2mo i, 1:colonists gained more than they lost by British trade and industrial
2mo i, 1:legislation. Certainly after the establishment of independence, when
2mo i, 1:free from these old restrictions, the Americans found themselves
2mo i, 1:handicapped by being treated as foreigners rather than favored traders
2mo i, 1:and the recipients of bounties in English markets.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Be that as it may, it appears that the colonists felt little irritation
2mo i, 1:against the mother country on account of the trade and navigation laws
2mo i, 1:enacted previous to the close of the French and Indian war. Relatively
2mo i, 1:few were engaged in the hat and iron industries as compared with those
2mo i, 1:in farming and planting, so that England's policy of restricting America
2mo i, 1:to agriculture did not conflict with the interests of the majority of
2mo i, 1:the inhabitants. The woolen industry was largely in the hands of women
2mo i, 1:and carried on in connection with their domestic duties, so that it was
2mo i, 1:not the sole support of any considerable number of people.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:As a matter of fact, moreover, the restrictive laws, especially those
2mo i, 1:relating to trade, were not rigidly enforced. Cargoes of tobacco were
2mo i, 1:boldly sent to continental ports without even so much as a bow to the
2mo i, 1:English government, to which duties should have been paid. Sugar and
2mo i, 1:molasses from the French and Dutch colonies were shipped into New
2mo i, 1:England in spite of the law. Royal officers sometimes protested against
2mo i, 1:smuggling and sometimes connived at it; but at no time did they succeed
2mo i, 1:in stopping it. Taken all in all, very little was heard of "the galling
2mo i, 1:restraints of trade" until after the French war, when the British
2mo i, 1:government suddenly entered upon a new course.

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:SUMMARY OF THE COLONIAL PERIOD
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In the period between the landing of the English at Jamestown, Virginia,
2mo i, 1:in 1607, and the close of the French and Indian war in 1763--a period of
2mo i, 1:a century and a half--a new nation was being prepared on this continent
2mo i, 1:to take its place among the powers of the earth. It was an epoch of
2mo i, 1:migration. Western Europe contributed emigrants of many races and
2mo i, 1:nationalities. The English led the way. Next to them in numerical
2mo i, 1:importance were the Scotch-Irish and the Germans. Into the melting pot
2mo i, 1:were also cast Dutch, Swedes, French, Jews, Welsh, and Irish. Thousands
2mo i, 1:of negroes were brought from Africa to till Southern fields or labor as
2mo i, 1:domestic servants in the North.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Why did they come? The reasons are various. Some of them, the Pilgrims
2mo i, 1:and Puritans of New England, the French Huguenots, Scotch-Irish and
2mo i, 1:Irish, and the Catholics of Maryland, fled from intolerant governments
2mo i, 1:that denied them the right to worship God according to the dictates of
2mo i, 1:their consciences. Thousands came to escape the bondage of poverty in
2mo i, 1:the Old World and to find free homes in America. Thousands, like the
2mo i, 1:negroes from Africa, were dragged here against their will. The lure of
2mo i, 1:adventure appealed to the restless and the lure of profits to the
2mo i, 1:enterprising merchants.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:How did they come? In some cases religious brotherhoods banded together
2mo i, 1:and borrowed or furnished the funds necessary to pay the way. In other
2mo i, 1:cases great trading companies were organized to found colonies. Again it
2mo i, 1:was the wealthy proprietor, like Lord Baltimore or William Penn, who
2mo i, 1:undertook to plant settlements. Many immigrants were able to pay their
2mo i, 1:own way across the sea. Others bound themselves out for a term of years
2mo i, 1:in exchange for the cost of the passage. Negroes were brought on account
2mo i, 1:of the profits derived from their sale as slaves.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Whatever the motive for their coming, however, they managed to get
2mo i, 1:across the sea. The immigrants set to work with a will. They cut down
2mo i, 1:forests, built houses, and laid out fields. They founded churches,
2mo i, 1:schools, and colleges. They set up forges and workshops. They spun and
2mo i, 1:wove. They fashioned ships and sailed the seas. They bartered and
2mo i, 1:traded. Here and there on favorable harbors they established centers of
2mo i, 1:commerce--Boston, Providence, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and
2mo i, 1:Charleston. As soon as a firm foothold was secured on the shore line
2mo i, 1:they pressed westward until, by the close of the colonial period, they
2mo i, 1:were already on the crest of the Alleghanies.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Though they were widely scattered along a thousand miles of seacoast,
2mo i, 1:the colonists were united in spirit by many common ties. The major
2mo i, 1:portion of them were Protestants. The language, the law, and the
2mo i, 1:literature of England furnished the basis of national unity. Most of the
2mo i, 1:colonists were engaged in the same hard task; that of conquering a
2mo i, 1:wilderness. To ties of kinship and language were added ties created by
2mo i, 1:necessity. They had to unite in defense; first, against the Indians and
2mo i, 1:later against the French. They were all subjects of the same
2mo i, 1:sovereign--the king of England. The English Parliament made laws for
2mo i, 1:them and the English government supervised their local affairs, their
2mo i, 1:trade, and their manufactures. Common forces assailed them. Common
2mo i, 1:grievances vexed them. Common hopes inspired them.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Many of the things which tended to unite them likewise tended to throw
2mo i, 1:them into opposition to the British Crown and Parliament. Most of them
2mo i, 1:were freeholders; that is, farmers who owned their own land and tilled
2mo i, 1:it with their own hands. A free soil nourished the spirit of freedom.
2mo i, 1:The majority of them were Dissenters, critics, not friends, of the
2mo i, 1:Church of England, that stanch defender of the British monarchy. Each
2mo i, 1:colony in time developed its own legislature elected by the voters; it
2mo i, 1:grew accustomed to making laws and laying taxes for itself. Here was a
2mo i, 1:people learning self-reliance and self-government. The attempts to
2mo i, 1:strengthen the Church of England in America and the transformation of
2mo i, 1:colonies into royal provinces only fanned the spirit of independence
2mo i, 1:which they were designed to quench.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Nevertheless, the Americans owed much of their prosperity to the
2mo i, 1:assistance of the government that irritated them. It was the protection
2mo i, 1:of the British navy that prevented Holland, Spain, and France from
2mo i, 1:wiping out their settlements. Though their manufacture and trade were
2mo i, 1:controlled in the interests of the mother country, they also enjoyed
2mo i, 1:great advantages in her markets. Free trade existed nowhere upon the
2mo i, 1:earth; but the broad empire of Britain was open to American ships and
2mo i, 1:merchandise. It could be said, with good reason, that the disadvantages
2mo i, 1:which the colonists suffered through British regulation of their
2mo i, 1:industry and trade were more than offset by the privileges they enjoyed.
2mo i, 1:Still that is somewhat beside the point, for mere economic advantage is
2mo i, 1:not necessarily the determining factor in the fate of peoples. A
2mo i, 1:thousand circumstances had helped to develop on this continent a nation,
2mo i, 1:to inspire it with a passion for independence, and to prepare it for a
2mo i, 1:destiny greater than that of a prosperous dominion of the British
2mo i, 1:empire. The economists, who tried to prove by logic unassailable that
2mo i, 1:America would be richer under the British flag, could not change the
2mo i, 1:spirit of Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin, or George
2mo i, 1:Washington.

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE NEW COURSE IN BRITISH IMPERIAL POLICY
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:On October 25, 1760, King George II died and the British crown passed to
2mo i, 1:his young grandson. The first George, the son of the Elector of Hanover
2mo i, 1:and Sophia the granddaughter of James I, was a thorough German who never
2mo i, 1:even learned to speak the language of the land over which he reigned.
2mo i, 1:The second George never saw England until he was a man. He spoke English
2mo i, 1:with an accent and until his death preferred his German home. During
2mo i, 1:their reign, the principle had become well established that the king did
2mo i, 1:not govern but acted only through ministers representing the majority in
2mo i, 1:Parliament.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:GEORGE III AND HIS SYSTEM
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Character of the New King.=--The third George rudely broke the
2mo i, 1:German tradition of his family. He resented the imputation that he was a
2mo i, 1:foreigner and on all occasions made a display of his British sympathies.
2mo i, 1:To the draft of his first speech to Parliament, he added the popular
2mo i, 1:phrase: "Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of
2mo i, 1:Briton." Macaulay, the English historian, certainly of no liking for
2mo i, 1:high royal prerogative, said of George: "The young king was a born
2mo i, 1:Englishman. All his tastes and habits, good and bad, were English. No
2mo i, 1:portion of his subjects had anything to reproach him with.... His age,
2mo i, 1:his appearance, and all that was known of his character conciliated
2mo i, 1:public favor. He was in the bloom of youth; his person and address were
2mo i, 1:pleasing; scandal imputed to him no vice; and flattery might without
2mo i, 1:glaring absurdity ascribe to him many princely virtues."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Nevertheless George III had been spoiled by his mother, his tutors, and
2mo i, 1:his courtiers. Under their influence he developed high and mighty
2mo i, 1:notions about the sacredness of royal authority and his duty to check
2mo i, 1:the pretensions of Parliament and the ministers dependent upon it. His
2mo i, 1:mother had dinned into his ears the slogan: "George, be king!" Lord
2mo i, 1:Bute, his teacher and adviser, had told him that his honor required him
2mo i, 1:to take an active part in the shaping of public policy and the making of
2mo i, 1:laws. Thus educated, he surrounded himself with courtiers who encouraged
2mo i, 1:him in the determination to rule as well as reign, to subdue all
2mo i, 1:parties, and to place himself at the head of the nation and empire.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: _From an old print._
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:GEORGE III]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Political Parties and George III.=--The state of the political parties
2mo i, 1:favored the plans of the king to restore some of the ancient luster of
2mo i, 1:the crown. The Whigs, who were composed mainly of the smaller
2mo i, 1:freeholders, merchants, inhabitants of towns, and Protestant
2mo i, 1:non-conformists, had grown haughty and overbearing through long
2mo i, 1:continuance in power and had as a consequence raised up many enemies in
2mo i, 1:their own ranks. Their opponents, the Tories, had by this time given up
2mo i, 1:all hope of restoring to the throne the direct Stuart line; but they
2mo i, 1:still cherished their old notions about divine right. With the
2mo i, 1:accession of George III the coveted opportunity came to them to rally
2mo i, 1:around the throne again. George received his Tory friends with open
2mo i, 1:arms, gave them offices, and bought them seats in the House of Commons.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The British Parliamentary System.=--The peculiarities of the British
2mo i, 1:Parliament at the time made smooth the way for the king and his allies
2mo i, 1:with their designs for controlling the entire government. In the first
2mo i, 1:place, the House of Lords was composed mainly of hereditary nobles whose
2mo i, 1:number the king could increase by the appointment of his favorites, as
2mo i, 1:of old. Though the members of the House of Commons were elected by
2mo i, 1:popular vote, they did not speak for the mass of English people. Great
2mo i, 1:towns like Leeds, Manchester, and Birmingham, for example, had no
2mo i, 1:representatives at all. While there were about eight million inhabitants
2mo i, 1:in Great Britain, there were in 1768 only about 160,000 voters; that is
2mo i, 1:to say, only about one in every ten adult males had a voice in the
2mo i, 1:government. Many boroughs returned one or more members to the Commons
2mo i, 1:although they had merely a handful of voters or in some instances no
2mo i, 1:voters at all. Furthermore, these tiny boroughs were often controlled by
2mo i, 1:lords who openly sold the right of representation to the highest bidder.
2mo i, 1:The "rotten-boroughs," as they were called by reformers, were a public
2mo i, 1:scandal, but George III readily made use of them to get his friends into
2mo i, 1:the House of Commons.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:GEORGE III'S MINISTERS AND THEIR COLONIAL POLICIES
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Grenville and the War Debt.=--Within a year after the accession of
2mo i, 1:George III, William Pitt was turned out of office, the king treating him
2mo i, 1:with "gross incivility" and the crowds shouting "Pitt forever!" The
2mo i, 1:direction of affairs was entrusted to men enjoying the king's
2mo i, 1:confidence. Leadership in the House of Commons fell to George Grenville,
2mo i, 1:a grave and laborious man who for years had groaned over the increasing
2mo i, 1:cost of government.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The first task after the conclusion of peace in 1763 was the adjustment
2mo i, 1:of the disordered finances of the kingdom. The debt stood at the highest
2mo i, 1:point in the history of the country. More revenue was absolutely
2mo i, 1:necessary and Grenville began to search for it, turning his attention
2mo i, 1:finally to the American colonies. In this quest he had the aid of a
2mo i, 1:zealous colleague, Charles Townshend, who had long been in public
2mo i, 1:service and was familiar with the difficulties encountered by royal
2mo i, 1:governors in America. These two men, with the support of the entire
2mo i, 1:ministry, inaugurated in February, 1763, "a new system of colonial
2mo i, 1:government. It was announced by authority that there were to be no more
2mo i, 1:requisitions from the king to the colonial assemblies for supplies, but
2mo i, 1:that the colonies were to be taxed instead by act of Parliament.
2mo i, 1:Colonial governors and judges were to be paid by the Crown; they were to
2mo i, 1:be supported by a standing army of twenty regiments; and all the
2mo i, 1:expenses of this force were to be met by parliamentary taxation."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Restriction of Paper Money (1763).=--Among the many complaints filed
2mo i, 1:before the board of trade were vigorous protests against the issuance of
2mo i, 1:paper money by the colonial legislatures. The new ministry provided a
2mo i, 1:remedy in the act of 1763, which declared void all colonial laws
2mo i, 1:authorizing paper money or extending the life of outstanding bills. This
2mo i, 1:law was aimed at the "cheap money" which the Americans were fond of
2mo i, 1:making when specie was scarce--money which they tried to force on their
2mo i, 1:English creditors in return for goods and in payment of the interest and
2mo i, 1:principal of debts. Thus the first chapter was written in the long
2mo i, 1:battle over sound money on this continent.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Limitation on Western Land Sales.=--Later in the same year (1763)
2mo i, 1:George III issued a royal proclamation providing, among other things,
2mo i, 1:for the government of the territory recently acquired by the treaty of
2mo i, 1:Paris from the French. One of the provisions in this royal decree
2mo i, 1:touched frontiersmen to the quick. The contests between the king's
2mo i, 1:officers and the colonists over the disposition of western lands had
2mo i, 1:been long and sharp. The Americans chafed at restrictions on
2mo i, 1:settlement. The more adventurous were continually moving west and
2mo i, 1:"squatting" on land purchased from the Indians or simply seized without
2mo i, 1:authority. To put an end to this, the king forbade all further purchases
2mo i, 1:from the Indians, reserving to the crown the right to acquire such lands
2mo i, 1:and dispose of them for settlement. A second provision in the same
2mo i, 1:proclamation vested the power of licensing trade with the Indians,
2mo i, 1:including the lucrative fur business, in the hands of royal officers in
2mo i, 1:the colonies. These two limitations on American freedom and enterprise
2mo i, 1:were declared to be in the interest of the crown and for the
2mo i, 1:preservation of the rights of the Indians against fraud and abuses.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Sugar Act of 1764.=--King George's ministers next turned their
2mo i, 1:attention to measures of taxation and trade. Since the heavy debt under
2mo i, 1:which England was laboring had been largely incurred in the defense of
2mo i, 1:America, nothing seemed more reasonable to them than the proposition
2mo i, 1:that the colonies should help to bear the burden which fell so heavily
2mo i, 1:upon the English taxpayer. The Sugar Act of 1764 was the result of this
2mo i, 1:reasoning. There was no doubt about the purpose of this law, for it was
2mo i, 1:set forth clearly in the title: "An act for granting certain duties in
2mo i, 1:the British colonies and plantations in America ... for applying the
2mo i, 1:produce of such duties ... towards defraying the expenses of defending,
2mo i, 1:protecting and securing the said colonies and plantations ... and for
2mo i, 1:more effectually preventing the clandestine conveyance of goods to and
2mo i, 1:from the said colonies and plantations and improving and securing the
2mo i, 1:trade between the same and Great Britain." The old Molasses Act had been
2mo i, 1:prohibitive; the Sugar Act of 1764 was clearly intended as a revenue
2mo i, 1:measure. Specified duties were laid upon sugar, indigo, calico, silks,
2mo i, 1:and many other commodities imported into the colonies. The enforcement
2mo i, 1:of the Molasses Act had been utterly neglected; but this Sugar Act had
2mo i, 1:"teeth in it." Special precautions as to bonds, security, and
2mo i, 1:registration of ship masters, accompanied by heavy penalties, promised
2mo i, 1:a vigorous execution of the new revenue law.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The strict terms of the Sugar Act were strengthened by administrative
2mo i, 1:measures. Under a law of the previous year the commanders of armed
2mo i, 1:vessels stationed along the American coast were authorized to stop,
2mo i, 1:search, and, on suspicion, seize merchant ships approaching colonial
2mo i, 1:ports. By supplementary orders, the entire British official force in
2mo i, 1:America was instructed to be diligent in the execution of all trade and
2mo i, 1:navigation laws. Revenue collectors, officers of the army and navy, and
2mo i, 1:royal governors were curtly ordered to the front to do their full duty
2mo i, 1:in the matter of law enforcement. The ordinary motives for the discharge
2mo i, 1:of official obligations were sharpened by an appeal to avarice, for
2mo i, 1:naval officers who seized offenders against the law were rewarded by
2mo i, 1:large prizes out of the forfeitures and penalties.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Stamp Act (1765).=--The Grenville-Townshend combination moved
2mo i, 1:steadily towards its goal. While the Sugar Act was under consideration
2mo i, 1:in Parliament, Grenville announced a plan for a stamp bill. The next
2mo i, 1:year it went through both Houses with a speed that must have astounded
2mo i, 1:its authors. The vote in the Commons stood 205 in favor to 49 against;
2mo i, 1:while in the Lords it was not even necessary to go through the formality
2mo i, 1:of a count. As George III was temporarily insane, the measure received
2mo i, 1:royal assent by a commission acting as a board of regency. Protests of
2mo i, 1:colonial agents in London were futile. "We might as well have hindered
2mo i, 1:the sun's progress!" exclaimed Franklin. Protests of a few opponents in
2mo i, 1:the Commons were equally vain. The ministry was firm in its course and
2mo i, 1:from all appearances the Stamp Act hardly roused as much as a languid
2mo i, 1:interest in the city of London. In fact, it is recorded that the fateful
2mo i, 1:measure attracted less notice than a bill providing for a commission to
2mo i, 1:act for the king when he was incapacitated.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The Stamp Act, like the Sugar Act, declared the purpose of the British
2mo i, 1:government to raise revenue in America "towards defraying the expenses
2mo i, 1:of defending, protecting, and securing the British colonies and
2mo i, 1:plantations in America." It was a long measure of more than fifty
2mo i, 1:sections, carefully planned and skillfully drawn. By its provisions
2mo i, 1:duties were imposed on practically all papers used in legal
2mo i, 1:transactions,--deeds, mortgages, inventories, writs, bail bonds,--on
2mo i, 1:licenses to practice law and sell liquor, on college diplomas, playing
2mo i, 1:cards, dice, pamphlets, newspapers, almanacs, calendars, and
2mo i, 1:advertisements. The drag net was closely knit, for scarcely anything
2mo i, 1:escaped.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Quartering Act (1765).=--The ministers were aware that the Stamp
2mo i, 1:Act would rouse opposition in America--how great they could not
2mo i, 1:conjecture. While the measure was being debated, a friend of General
2mo i, 1:Wolfe, Colonel Barre, who knew America well, gave them an ominous
2mo i, 1:warning in the Commons. "Believe me--remember I this day told you so--"
2mo i, 1:he exclaimed, "the same spirit of freedom which actuated that people at
2mo i, 1:first will accompany them still ... a people jealous of their liberties
2mo i, 1:and who will vindicate them, if ever they should be violated." The
2mo i, 1:answer of the ministry to a prophecy of force was a threat of force.
2mo i, 1:Preparations were accordingly made to dispatch a larger number of
2mo i, 1:soldiers than usual to the colonies, and the ink was hardly dry on the
2mo i, 1:Stamp Act when Parliament passed the Quartering Act ordering the
2mo i, 1:colonists to provide accommodations for the soldiers who were to enforce
2mo i, 1:the new laws. "We have the power to tax them," said one of the ministry,
2mo i, 1:"and we will tax them."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:COLONIAL RESISTANCE FORCES REPEAL
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Popular Opposition.=--The Stamp Act was greeted in America by an
2mo i, 1:outburst of denunciation. The merchants of the seaboard cities took the
2mo i, 1:lead in making a dignified but unmistakable protest, agreeing not to
2mo i, 1:import British goods while the hated law stood upon the books. Lawyers,
2mo i, 1:some of them incensed at the heavy taxes on their operations and others
2mo i, 1:intimidated by patriots who refused to permit them to use stamped
2mo i, 1:papers, joined with the merchants. Aristocratic colonial Whigs, who had
2mo i, 1:long grumbled at the administration of royal governors, protested
2mo i, 1:against taxation without their consent, as the Whigs had done in old
2mo i, 1:England. There were Tories, however, in the colonies as in England--many
2mo i, 1:of them of the official class--who denounced the merchants, lawyers, and
2mo i, 1:Whig aristocrats as "seditious, factious and republican." Yet the
2mo i, 1:opposition to the Stamp Act and its accompanying measure, the Quartering
2mo i, 1:Act, grew steadily all through the summer of 1765.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In a little while it was taken up in the streets and along the
2mo i, 1:countryside. All through the North and in some of the Southern colonies,
2mo i, 1:there sprang up, as if by magic, committees and societies pledged to
2mo i, 1:resist the Stamp Act to the bitter end. These popular societies were
2mo i, 1:known as Sons of Liberty and Daughters of Liberty: the former including
2mo i, 1:artisans, mechanics, and laborers; and the latter, patriotic women. Both
2mo i, 1:groups were alike in that they had as yet taken little part in public
2mo i, 1:affairs. Many artisans, as well as all the women, were excluded from the
2mo i, 1:right to vote for colonial assemblymen.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:While the merchants and Whig gentlemen confined their efforts chiefly to
2mo i, 1:drafting well-phrased protests against British measures, the Sons of
2mo i, 1:Liberty operated in the streets and chose rougher measures. They stirred
2mo i, 1:up riots in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston when attempts
2mo i, 1:were made to sell the stamps. They sacked and burned the residences of
2mo i, 1:high royal officers. They organized committees of inquisition who by
2mo i, 1:threats and intimidation curtailed the sale of British goods and the use
2mo i, 1:of stamped papers. In fact, the Sons of Liberty carried their operations
2mo i, 1:to such excesses that many mild opponents of the stamp tax were
2mo i, 1:frightened and drew back in astonishment at the forces they had
2mo i, 1:unloosed. The Daughters of Liberty in a quieter way were making a very
2mo i, 1:effective resistance to the sale of the hated goods by spurring on
2mo i, 1:domestic industries, their own particular province being the manufacture
2mo i, 1:of clothing, and devising substitutes for taxed foods. They helped to
2mo i, 1:feed and clothe their families without buying British goods.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Legislative Action against the Stamp Act.=--Leaders in the colonial
2mo i, 1:assemblies, accustomed to battle against British policies, supported the
2mo i, 1:popular protest. The Stamp Act was signed on March 22, 1765. On May 30,
2mo i, 1:the Virginia House of Burgesses passed a set of resolutions declaring
2mo i, 1:that the General Assembly of the colony alone had the right to lay taxes
2mo i, 1:upon the inhabitants and that attempts to impose them otherwise were
2mo i, 1:"illegal, unconstitutional, and unjust." It was in support of these
2mo i, 1:resolutions that Patrick Henry uttered the immortal challenge: "Caesar
2mo i, 1:had his Brutus, Charles I his Cromwell, and George III...." Cries of
2mo i, 1:"Treason" were calmly met by the orator who finished: "George III may
2mo i, 1:profit by their example. If that be treason, make the most of it."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: PATRICK HENRY]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Stamp Act Congress.=--The Massachusetts Assembly answered the call
2mo i, 1:of Virginia by inviting the colonies to elect delegates to a Congress to
2mo i, 1:be held in New York to discuss the situation. Nine colonies responded
2mo i, 1:and sent representatives. The delegates, while professing the warmest
2mo i, 1:affection for the king's person and government, firmly spread on record
2mo i, 1:a series of resolutions that admitted of no double meaning. They
2mo i, 1:declared that taxes could not be imposed without their consent, given
2mo i, 1:through their respective colonial assemblies; that the Stamp Act showed
2mo i, 1:a tendency to subvert their rights and liberties; that the recent trade
2mo i, 1:acts were burdensome and grievous; and that the right to petition the
2mo i, 1:king and Parliament was their heritage. They thereupon made "humble
2mo i, 1:supplication" for the repeal of the Stamp Act.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The Stamp Act Congress was more than an assembly of protest. It marked
2mo i, 1:the rise of a new agency of government to express the will of America.
2mo i, 1:It was the germ of a government which in time was to supersede the
2mo i, 1:government of George III in the colonies. It foreshadowed the Congress
2mo i, 1:of the United States under the Constitution. It was a successful attempt
2mo i, 1:at union. "There ought to be no New England men," declared Christopher
2mo i, 1:Gadsden, in the Stamp Act Congress, "no New Yorkers known on the
2mo i, 1:Continent, but all of us Americans."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Repeal of the Stamp Act and the Sugar Act.=--The effect of American
2mo i, 1:resistance on opinion in England was telling. Commerce with the colonies
2mo i, 1:had been effectively boycotted by the Americans; ships lay idly swinging
2mo i, 1:at the wharves; bankruptcy threatened hundreds of merchants in London,
2mo i, 1:Bristol, and Liverpool. Workingmen in the manufacturing towns of England
2mo i, 1:were thrown out of employment. The government had sown folly and was
2mo i, 1:reaping, in place of the coveted revenue, rebellion.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Perplexed by the storm they had raised, the ministers summoned to the
2mo i, 1:bar of the House of Commons, Benjamin Franklin, the agent for
2mo i, 1:Pennsylvania, who was in London. "Do you think it right," asked
2mo i, 1:Grenville, "that America should be protected by this country and pay no
2mo i, 1:part of the expenses?" The answer was brief: "That is not the case; the
2mo i, 1:colonies raised, clothed, and paid during the last war twenty-five
2mo i, 1:thousand men and spent many millions." Then came an inquiry whether the
2mo i, 1:colonists would accept a modified stamp act. "No, never," replied
2mo i, 1:Franklin, "never! They will never submit to it!" It was next suggested
2mo i, 1:that military force might compel obedience to law. Franklin had a ready
2mo i, 1:answer. "They cannot force a man to take stamps.... They may not find a
2mo i, 1:rebellion; they may, indeed, make one."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The repeal of the Stamp Act was moved in the House of Commons a few days
2mo i, 1:later. The sponsor for the repeal spoke of commerce interrupted, debts
2mo i, 1:due British merchants placed in jeopardy, Manchester industries closed,
2mo i, 1:workingmen unemployed, oppression instituted, and the loss of the
2mo i, 1:colonies threatened. Pitt and Edmund Burke, the former near the close
2mo i, 1:of his career, the latter just beginning his, argued cogently in favor
2mo i, 1:of retracing the steps taken the year before. Grenville refused.
2mo i, 1:"America must learn," he wailed, "that prayers are not to be brought to
2mo i, 1:Caesar through riot and sedition." His protests were idle. The Commons
2mo i, 1:agreed to the repeal on February 22, 1766, amid the cheers of the
2mo i, 1:victorious majority. It was carried through the Lords in the face of
2mo i, 1:strong opposition and, on March 18, reluctantly signed by the king, now
2mo i, 1:restored to his right mind.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In rescinding the Stamp Act, Parliament did not admit the contention of
2mo i, 1:the Americans that it was without power to tax them. On the contrary, it
2mo i, 1:accompanied the repeal with a Declaratory Act. It announced that the
2mo i, 1:colonies were subordinate to the crown and Parliament of Great Britain;
2mo i, 1:that the king and Parliament therefore had undoubted authority to make
2mo i, 1:laws binding the colonies in all cases whatsoever; and that the
2mo i, 1:resolutions and proceedings of the colonists denying such authority were
2mo i, 1:null and void.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The repeal was greeted by the colonists with great popular
2mo i, 1:demonstrations. Bells were rung; toasts to the king were drunk; and
2mo i, 1:trade resumed its normal course. The Declaratory Act, as a mere paper
2mo i, 1:resolution, did not disturb the good humor of those who again cheered
2mo i, 1:the name of King George. Their confidence was soon strengthened by the
2mo i, 1:news that even the Sugar Act had been repealed, thus practically
2mo i, 1:restoring the condition of affairs before Grenville and Townshend
2mo i, 1:inaugurated their policy of "thoroughness."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:RESUMPTION OF BRITISH REVENUE AND COMMERCIAL POLICIES
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Townshend Acts (1767).=--The triumph of the colonists was brief.
2mo i, 1:Though Pitt, the friend of America, was once more prime minister, and
2mo i, 1:seated in the House of Lords as the Earl of Chatham, his severe illness
2mo i, 1:gave to Townshend and the Tory party practical control over Parliament.
2mo i, 1:Unconvinced by the experience with the Stamp Act, Townshend brought
2mo i, 1:forward and pushed through both Houses of Parliament three measures,
2mo i, 1:which to this day are associated with his name. First among his
2mo i, 1:restrictive laws was that of June 29, 1767, which placed the enforcement
2mo i, 1:of the collection of duties and customs on colonial imports and exports
2mo i, 1:in the hands of British commissioners appointed by the king, resident in
2mo i, 1:the colonies, paid from the British treasury, and independent of all
2mo i, 1:control by the colonists. The second measure of the same date imposed a
2mo i, 1:tax on lead, glass, paint, tea, and a few other articles imported into
2mo i, 1:the colonies, the revenue derived from the duties to be applied toward
2mo i, 1:the payment of the salaries and other expenses of royal colonial
2mo i, 1:officials. A third measure was the Tea Act of July 2, 1767, aimed at the
2mo i, 1:tea trade which the Americans carried on illegally with foreigners. This
2mo i, 1:law abolished the duty which the East India Company had to pay in
2mo i, 1:England on tea exported to America, for it was thought that English tea
2mo i, 1:merchants might thus find it possible to undersell American tea
2mo i, 1:smugglers.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Writs of Assistance Legalized by Parliament.=--Had Parliament been
2mo i, 1:content with laying duties, just as a manifestation of power and right,
2mo i, 1:and neglected their collection, perhaps little would have been heard of
2mo i, 1:the Townshend Acts. It provided, however, for the strict, even the
2mo i, 1:harsh, enforcement of the law. It ordered customs officers to remain at
2mo i, 1:their posts and put an end to smuggling. In the revenue act of June 29,
2mo i, 1:1767, it expressly authorized the superior courts of the colonies to
2mo i, 1:issue "writs of assistance," empowering customs officers to enter "any
2mo i, 1:house, warehouse, shop, cellar, or other place in the British colonies
2mo i, 1:or plantations in America to search for and seize" prohibited or
2mo i, 1:smuggled goods.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The writ of assistance, which was a general search warrant issued to
2mo i, 1:revenue officers, was an ancient device hateful to a people who
2mo i, 1:cherished the spirit of personal independence and who had made actual
2mo i, 1:gains in the practice of civil liberty. To allow a "minion of the law"
2mo i, 1:to enter a man's house and search his papers and premises, was too much
2mo i, 1:for the emotions of people who had fled to America in a quest for
2mo i, 1:self-government and free homes, who had braved such hardships to
2mo i, 1:establish them, and who wanted to trade without official interference.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The writ of assistance had been used in Massachusetts in 1755 to prevent
2mo i, 1:illicit trade with Canada and had aroused a violent hostility at that
2mo i, 1:time. In 1761 it was again the subject of a bitter controversy which
2mo i, 1:arose in connection with the application of a customs officer to a
2mo i, 1:Massachusetts court for writs of assistance "as usual." This application
2mo i, 1:was vainly opposed by James Otis in a speech of five hours' duration--a
2mo i, 1:speech of such fire and eloquence that it sent every man who heard it
2mo i, 1:away "ready to take up arms against writs of assistance." Otis denounced
2mo i, 1:the practice as an exercise of arbitrary power which had cost one king
2mo i, 1:his head and another his throne, a tyrant's device which placed the
2mo i, 1:liberty of every man in jeopardy, enabling any petty officer to work
2mo i, 1:possible malice on any innocent citizen on the merest suspicion, and to
2mo i, 1:spread terror and desolation through the land. "What a scene," he
2mo i, 1:exclaimed, "does this open! Every man, prompted by revenge, ill-humor,
2mo i, 1:or wantonness to inspect the inside of his neighbor's house, may get a
2mo i, 1:writ of assistance. Others will ask it from self-defense; one arbitrary
2mo i, 1:exertion will provoke another until society is involved in tumult and
2mo i, 1:blood." He did more than attack the writ itself. He said that Parliament
2mo i, 1:could not establish it because it was against the British constitution.
2mo i, 1:This was an assertion resting on slender foundation, but it was quickly
2mo i, 1:echoed by the people. Then and there James Otis sounded the call to
2mo i, 1:America to resist the exercise of arbitrary power by royal officers.
2mo i, 1:"Then and there," wrote John Adams, "the child Independence was born."
2mo i, 1:Such was the hated writ that Townshend proposed to put into the hands of
2mo i, 1:customs officers in his grim determination to enforce the law.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The New York Assembly Suspended.=--In the very month that Townshend's
2mo i, 1:Acts were signed by the king, Parliament took a still more drastic step.
2mo i, 1:The assembly of New York, protesting against the "ruinous and
2mo i, 1:insupportable" expense involved, had failed to make provision for the
2mo i, 1:care of British troops in accordance with the terms of the Quartering
2mo i, 1:Act. Parliament therefore suspended the assembly until it promised to
2mo i, 1:obey the law. It was not until a third election was held that compliance
2mo i, 1:with the Quartering Act was wrung from the reluctant province. In the
2mo i, 1:meantime, all the colonies had learned on how frail a foundation their
2mo i, 1:representative bodies rested.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:RENEWED RESISTANCE IN AMERICA
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Massachusetts Circular (1768).=--Massachusetts, under the
2mo i, 1:leadership of Samuel Adams, resolved to resist the policy of renewed
2mo i, 1:intervention in America. At his suggestion the assembly adopted a
2mo i, 1:Circular Letter addressed to the assemblies of the other colonies
2mo i, 1:informing them of the state of affairs in Massachusetts and roundly
2mo i, 1:condemning the whole British program. The Circular Letter declared that
2mo i, 1:Parliament had no right to lay taxes on Americans without their consent
2mo i, 1:and that the colonists could not, from the nature of the case, be
2mo i, 1:represented in Parliament. It went on shrewdly to submit to
2mo i, 1:consideration the question as to whether any people could be called free
2mo i, 1:who were subjected to governors and judges appointed by the crown and
2mo i, 1:paid out of funds raised independently. It invited the other colonies,
2mo i, 1:in the most temperate tones, to take thought about the common
2mo i, 1:predicament in which they were all placed.

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Dissolution of Assemblies.=--The governor of Massachusetts, hearing
2mo i, 1:of the Circular Letter, ordered the assembly to rescind its appeal. On
2mo i, 1:meeting refusal, he promptly dissolved it. The Maryland, Georgia, and
2mo i, 1:South Carolina assemblies indorsed the Circular Letter and were also
2mo i, 1:dissolved at once. The Virginia House of Burgesses, thoroughly aroused,
2mo i, 1:passed resolutions on May 16, 1769, declaring that the sole right of
2mo i, 1:imposing taxes in Virginia was vested in its legislature, asserting anew
2mo i, 1:the right of petition to the crown, condemning the transportation of
2mo i, 1:persons accused of crimes or trial beyond the seas, and beseeching the
2mo i, 1:king for a redress of the general grievances. The immediate dissolution
2mo i, 1:of the Virginia assembly, in its turn, was the answer of the royal
2mo i, 1:governor.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Boston Massacre.=--American opposition to the British authorities
2mo i, 1:kept steadily rising as assemblies were dissolved, the houses of
2mo i, 1:citizens searched, and troops distributed in increasing numbers among
2mo i, 1:the centers of discontent. Merchants again agreed not to import British
2mo i, 1:goods, the Sons of Liberty renewed their agitation, and women set about
2mo i, 1:the patronage of home products still more loyally.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:On the night of March 5, 1770, a crowd on the streets of Boston began to
2mo i, 1:jostle and tease some British regulars stationed in the town. Things
2mo i, 1:went from bad to worse until some "boys and young fellows" began to
2mo i, 1:throw snowballs and stones. Then the exasperated soldiers fired into the
2mo i, 1:crowd, killing five and wounding half a dozen more. The day after the
2mo i, 1:"massacre," a mass meeting was held in the town and Samuel Adams was
2mo i, 1:sent to demand the withdrawal of the soldiers. The governor hesitated
2mo i, 1:and tried to compromise. Finding Adams relentless, the governor yielded
2mo i, 1:and ordered the regulars away.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The Boston Massacre stirred the country from New Hampshire to Georgia.
2mo i, 1:Popular passions ran high. The guilty soldiers were charged with murder.
2mo i, 1:Their defense was undertaken, in spite of the wrath of the populace, by
2mo i, 1:John Adams and Josiah Quincy, who as lawyers thought even the worst
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:offenders entitled to their full rights in law. In his speech to the
2mo i, 1:jury, however, Adams warned the British government against its course,
2mo i, 1:saying, that "from the nature of things soldiers quartered in a populous
2mo i, 1:town will always occasion two mobs where they will prevent one." Two of
2mo i, 1:the soldiers were convicted and lightly punished.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Resistance in the South.=--The year following the Boston Massacre some
2mo i, 1:citizens of North Carolina, goaded by the conduct of the royal governor,
2mo i, 1:openly resisted his authority. Many were killed as a result and seven
2mo i, 1:who were taken prisoners were hanged as traitors. A little later royal
2mo i, 1:troops and local militia met in a pitched battle near Alamance River,
2mo i, 1:called the "Lexington of the South."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The _Gaspee_ Affair and the Virginia Resolutions of 1773.=--On sea as
2mo i, 1:well as on land, friction between the royal officers and the colonists
2mo i, 1:broke out into overt acts. While patrolling Narragansett Bay looking for
2mo i, 1:smugglers one day in 1772, the armed ship, _Gaspee_, ran ashore and was
2mo i, 1:caught fast. During the night several men from Providence boarded the
2mo i, 1:vessel and, after seizing the crew, set it on fire. A royal commission,
2mo i, 1:sent to Rhode Island to discover the offenders and bring them to
2mo i, 1:account, failed because it could not find a single informer. The very
2mo i, 1:appointment of such a commission aroused the patriots of Virginia to
2mo i, 1:action; and in March, 1773, the House of Burgesses passed a resolution
2mo i, 1:creating a standing committee of correspondence to develop cooperation
2mo i, 1:among the colonies in resistance to British measures.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Boston Tea Party.=--Although the British government, finding the
2mo i, 1:Townshend revenue act a failure, repealed in 1770 all the duties except
2mo i, 1:that on tea, it in no way relaxed its resolve to enforce the other
2mo i, 1:commercial regulations it had imposed on the colonies. Moreover,
2mo i, 1:Parliament decided to relieve the British East India Company of the
2mo i, 1:financial difficulties into which it had fallen partly by reason of the
2mo i, 1:Tea Act and the colonial boycott that followed. In 1773 it agreed to
2mo i, 1:return to the Company the regular import duties, levied in England, on
2mo i, 1:all tea transshipped to America. A small impost of three pence, to be
2mo i, 1:collected in America, was left as a reminder of the principle laid down
2mo i, 1:in the Declaratory Act that Parliament had the right to tax the
2mo i, 1:colonists.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:This arrangement with the East India Company was obnoxious to the
2mo i, 1:colonists for several reasons. It was an act of favoritism for one
2mo i, 1:thing, in the interest of a great monopoly. For another thing, it
2mo i, 1:promised to dump on the American market, suddenly, an immense amount of
2mo i, 1:cheap tea and so cause heavy losses to American merchants who had large
2mo i, 1:stocks on hand. It threatened with ruin the business of all those who
2mo i, 1:were engaged in clandestine trade with the Dutch. It carried with it an
2mo i, 1:irritating tax of three pence on imports. In Charleston, Annapolis, New
2mo i, 1:York, and Boston, captains of ships who brought tea under this act were
2mo i, 1:roughly handled. One night in December, 1773, a band of Boston citizens,
2mo i, 1:disguised as Indians, boarded the hated tea ships and dumped the cargo
2mo i, 1:into the harbor. This was serious business, for it was open, flagrant,
2mo i, 1:determined violation of the law. As such the British government viewed
2mo i, 1:it.

2mo i, 1:RETALIATION BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Reception of the News of the Tea Riot.=--The news of the tea riot in
2mo i, 1:Boston confirmed King George in his conviction that there should be no
2mo i, 1:soft policy in dealing with his American subjects. "The die is cast," he
2mo i, 1:stated with evident satisfaction. "The colonies must either triumph or
2mo i, 1:submit.... If we take the resolute part, they will undoubtedly be very
2mo i, 1:meek." Lord George Germain characterized the tea party as "the
2mo i, 1:proceedings of a tumultuous and riotous rabble who ought, if they had
2mo i, 1:the least prudence, to follow their mercantile employments and not
2mo i, 1:trouble themselves with politics and government, which they do not
2mo i, 1:understand." This expressed, in concise form, exactly the sentiments of
2mo i, 1:Lord North, who had then for three years been the king's chief minister.
2mo i, 1:Even Pitt, Lord Chatham, was prepared to support the government in
2mo i, 1:upholding its authority.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Five Intolerable Acts.=--Parliament, beginning on March 31, 1774,
2mo i, 1:passed five stringent measures, known in American history as the five
2mo i, 1:"intolerable acts." They were aimed at curing the unrest in America. The
2mo i, 1:_first_ of them was a bill absolutely shutting the port of Boston to
2mo i, 1:commerce with the outside world. The _second_, following closely,
2mo i, 1:revoked the Massachusetts charter of 1691 and provided furthermore that
2mo i, 1:the councilors should be appointed by the king, that all judges should
2mo i, 1:be named by the royal governor, and that town meetings (except to elect
2mo i, 1:certain officers) could not be held without the governor's consent. A
2mo i, 1:_third_ measure, after denouncing the "utter subversion of all lawful
2mo i, 1:government" in the provinces, authorized royal agents to transfer to
2mo i, 1:Great Britain or to other colonies the trials of officers or other
2mo i, 1:persons accused of murder in connection with the enforcement of the law.
2mo i, 1:The _fourth_ act legalized the quartering of troops in Massachusetts
2mo i, 1:towns. The _fifth_ of the measures was the Quebec Act, which granted
2mo i, 1:religious toleration to the Catholics in Canada, extended the boundaries
2mo i, 1:of Quebec southward to the Ohio River, and established, in this western
2mo i, 1:region, government by a viceroy.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The intolerable acts went through Parliament with extraordinary
2mo i, 1:celerity. There was an opposition, alert and informed; but it was
2mo i, 1:ineffective. Burke spoke eloquently against the Boston port bill,
2mo i, 1:condemning it roundly for punishing the innocent with the guilty, and
2mo i, 1:showing how likely it was to bring grave consequences in its train. He
2mo i, 1:was heard with respect and his pleas were rejected. The bill passed both
2mo i, 1:houses without a division, the entry "unanimous" being made upon their
2mo i, 1:journals although it did not accurately represent the state of opinion.
2mo i, 1:The law destroying the charter of Massachusetts passed the Commons by a
2mo i, 1:vote of three to one; and the third intolerable act by a vote of four to
2mo i, 1:one. The triumph of the ministry was complete. "What passed in Boston,"
2mo i, 1:exclaimed the great jurist, Lord Mansfield, "is the overt act of High
2mo i, 1:Treason proceeding from our over lenity and want of foresight." The
2mo i, 1:crown and Parliament were united in resorting to punitive measures.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In the colonies the laws were received with consternation. To the
2mo i, 1:American Protestants, the Quebec Act was the most offensive. That
2mo i, 1:project they viewed not as an act of grace or of mercy but as a direct
2mo i, 1:attempt to enlist French Canadians on the side of Great Britain. The
2mo i, 1:British government did not grant religious toleration to Catholics
2mo i, 1:either at home or in Ireland and the Americans could see no good motive
2mo i, 1:in granting it in North America. The act was also offensive because
2mo i, 1:Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia had, under their charters,
2mo i, 1:large claims in the territory thus annexed to Quebec.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:To enforce these intolerable acts the military arm of the British
2mo i, 1:government was brought into play. The commander-in-chief of the armed
2mo i, 1:forces in America, General Gage, was appointed governor of
2mo i, 1:Massachusetts. Reinforcements were brought to the colonies, for now King
2mo i, 1:George was to give "the rebels," as he called them, a taste of strong
2mo i, 1:medicine. The majesty of his law was to be vindicated by force.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:FROM REFORM TO REVOLUTION IN AMERICA
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Doctrine of Natural Rights.=--The dissolution of assemblies, the
2mo i, 1:destruction of charters, and the use of troops produced in the colonies
2mo i, 1:a new phase in the struggle. In the early days of the contest with the
2mo i, 1:British ministry, the Americans spoke of their "rights as Englishmen"
2mo i, 1:and condemned the acts of Parliament as unlawful, as violating the
2mo i, 1:principles of the English constitution under which they all lived. When
2mo i, 1:they saw that such arguments had no effect on Parliament, they turned
2mo i, 1:for support to their "natural rights." The latter doctrine, in the form
2mo i, 1:in which it was employed by the colonists, was as English as the
2mo i, 1:constitutional argument. John Locke had used it with good effect in
2mo i, 1:defense of the English revolution in the seventeenth century. American
2mo i, 1:leaders, familiar with the writings of Locke, also took up his thesis in
2mo i, 1:the hour of their distress. They openly declared that their rights did
2mo i, 1:not rest after all upon the English constitution or a charter from the
2mo i, 1:crown. "Old Magna Carta was not the beginning of all things," retorted
2mo i, 1:Otis when the constitutional argument failed. "A time may come when
2mo i, 1:Parliament shall declare every American charter void, but the natural,
2mo i, 1:inherent, and inseparable rights of the colonists as men and as citizens
2mo i, 1:would remain and whatever became of charters can never be abolished
2mo i, 1:until the general conflagration." Of the same opinion was the young and
2mo i, 1:impetuous Alexander Hamilton. "The sacred rights of mankind," he
2mo i, 1:exclaimed, "are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty
2mo i, 1:records. They are written as with a sunbeam in the whole volume of human
2mo i, 1:destiny by the hand of divinity itself, and can never be erased or
2mo i, 1:obscured by mortal power."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Firm as the American leaders were in the statement and defense of their
2mo i, 1:rights, there is every reason for believing that in the beginning they
2mo i, 1:hoped to confine the conflict to the realm of opinion. They constantly
2mo i, 1:avowed that they were loyal to the king when protesting in the strongest
2mo i, 1:language against his policies. Even Otis, regarded by the loyalists as a
2mo i, 1:firebrand, was in fact attempting to avert revolution by winning
2mo i, 1:concessions from England. "I argue this cause with the greater
2mo i, 1:pleasure," he solemnly urged in his speech against the writs of
2mo i, 1:assistance, "as it is in favor of British liberty ... and as it is in
2mo i, 1:opposition to a kind of power, the exercise of which in former periods
2mo i, 1:cost one king of England his head and another his throne."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Burke Offers the Doctrine of Conciliation.=--The flooding tide of
2mo i, 1:American sentiment was correctly measured by one Englishman at least,
2mo i, 1:Edmund Burke, who quickly saw that attempts to restrain the rise of
2mo i, 1:American democracy were efforts to reverse the processes of nature. He
2mo i, 1:saw how fixed and rooted in the nature of things was the American
2mo i, 1:spirit--how inevitable, how irresistible. He warned his countrymen that
2mo i, 1:there were three ways of handling the delicate situation--and only
2mo i, 1:three. One was to remove the cause of friction by changing the spirit of
2mo i, 1:the colonists--an utter impossibility because that spirit was grounded
2mo i, 1:in the essential circumstances of American life. The second was to
2mo i, 1:prosecute American leaders as criminals; of this he begged his
2mo i, 1:countrymen to beware lest the colonists declare that "a government
2mo i, 1:against which a claim of liberty is tantamount to high treason is a
2mo i, 1:government to which submission is equivalent to slavery." The third and
2mo i, 1:right way to meet the problem, Burke concluded, was to accept the
2mo i, 1:American spirit, repeal the obnoxious measures, and receive the colonies
2mo i, 1:into equal partnership.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Events Produce the Great Decision.=--The right way, indicated by Burke,
2mo i, 1:was equally impossible to George III and the majority in Parliament. To
2mo i, 1:their narrow minds, American opinion was contemptible and American
2mo i, 1:resistance unlawful, riotous, and treasonable. The correct way, in their
2mo i, 1:view, was to dispatch more troops to crush the "rebels"; and that very
2mo i, 1:act took the contest from the realm of opinion. As John Adams said:
2mo i, 1:"Facts are stubborn things." Opinions were unseen, but marching soldiers
2mo i, 1:were visible to the veriest street urchin. "Now," said Gouverneur
2mo i, 1:Morris, "the sheep, simple as they are, cannot be gulled as heretofore."
2mo i, 1:It was too late to talk about the excellence of the British
2mo i, 1:constitution. If any one is bewildered by the controversies of modern
2mo i, 1:historians as to why the crisis came at last, he can clarify his
2mo i, 1:understanding by reading again Edmund Burke's stately oration, _On
2mo i, 1:Conciliation with America_.

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:RESISTANCE AND RETALIATION
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Continental Congress.=--When the news of the "intolerable acts"
2mo i, 1:reached America, every one knew what strong medicine Parliament was
2mo i, 1:prepared to administer to all those who resisted its authority. The
2mo i, 1:cause of Massachusetts became the cause of all the colonies. Opposition
2mo i, 1:to British policy, hitherto local and spasmodic, now took on a national
2mo i, 1:character. To local committees and provincial conventions was added a
2mo i, 1:Continental Congress, appropriately called by Massachusetts on June 17,
2mo i, 1:1774, at the instigation of Samuel Adams. The response to the summons
2mo i, 1:was electric. By hurried and irregular methods delegates were elected
2mo i, 1:during the summer, and on September 5 the Congress duly assembled in
2mo i, 1:Carpenter's Hall in Philadelphia. Many of the greatest men in America
2mo i, 1:were there--George Washington and Patrick Henry from Virginia and John
2mo i, 1:and Samuel Adams from Massachusetts. Every shade of opinion was
2mo i, 1:represented. Some were impatient with mild devices; the majority favored
2mo i, 1:moderation.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The Congress drew up a declaration of American rights and stated in
2mo i, 1:clear and dignified language the grievances of the colonists. It
2mo i, 1:approved the resistance to British measures offered by Massachusetts and
2mo i, 1:promised the united support of all sections. It prepared an address to
2mo i, 1:King George and another to the people of England, disavowing the idea of
2mo i, 1:independence but firmly attacking the policies pursued by the British
2mo i, 1:government.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Non-Importation Agreement.=--The Congress was not content, however,
2mo i, 1:with professions of faith and with petitions. It took one revolutionary
2mo i, 1:step. It agreed to stop the importation of British goods into America,
2mo i, 1:and the enforcement of this agreement it placed in the hands of local
2mo i, 1:"committees of safety and inspection," to be elected by the qualified
2mo i, 1:voters. The significance of this action is obvious. Congress threw
2mo i, 1:itself athwart British law. It made a rule to bind American citizens and
2mo i, 1:to be carried into effect by American officers. It set up a state within
2mo i, 1:the British state and laid down a test of allegiance to the new order.
2mo i, 1:The colonists, who up to this moment had been wavering, had to choose
2mo i, 1:one authority or the other. They were for the enforcement of the
2mo i, 1:non-importation agreement or they were against it. They either bought
2mo i, 1:English goods or they did not. In the spirit of the toast--"May Britain
2mo i, 1:be wise and America be free"--the first Continental Congress adjourned
2mo i, 1:in October, having appointed the tenth of May following for the meeting
2mo i, 1:of a second Congress, should necessity require.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Lord North's "Olive Branch."=--When the news of the action of the
2mo i, 1:American Congress reached England, Pitt and Burke warmly urged a repeal
2mo i, 1:of the obnoxious laws, but in vain. All they could wring from the prime
2mo i, 1:minister, Lord North, was a set of "conciliatory resolutions" proposing
2mo i, 1:to relieve from taxation any colony that would assume its share of
2mo i, 1:imperial defense and make provision for supporting the local officers of
2mo i, 1:the crown. This "olive branch" was accompanied by a resolution assuring
2mo i, 1:the king of support at all hazards in suppressing the rebellion and by
2mo i, 1:the restraining act of March 30, 1775, which in effect destroyed the
2mo i, 1:commerce of New England.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Bloodshed at Lexington and Concord (April 19, 1775).=--Meanwhile the
2mo i, 1:British authorities in Massachusetts relaxed none of their efforts in
2mo i, 1:upholding British sovereignty. General Gage, hearing that military
2mo i, 1:stores had been collected at Concord, dispatched a small force to seize
2mo i, 1:them. By this act he precipitated the conflict he had sought to avoid.
2mo i, 1:At Lexington, on the road to Concord, occurred "the little thing" that
2mo i, 1:produced "the great event." An unexpected collision beyond the thought
2mo i, 1:or purpose of any man had transferred the contest from the forum to the
2mo i, 1:battle field.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Second Continental Congress.=--Though blood had been shed and war
2mo i, 1:was actually at hand, the second Continental Congress, which met at
2mo i, 1:Philadelphia in May, 1775, was not yet convinced that conciliation was
2mo i, 1:beyond human power. It petitioned the king to interpose on behalf of the
2mo i, 1:colonists in order that the empire might avoid the calamities of civil
2mo i, 1:war. On the last day of July, it made a temperate but firm answer to
2mo i, 1:Lord North's offer of conciliation, stating that the proposal was
2mo i, 1:unsatisfactory because it did not renounce the right to tax or repeal
2mo i, 1:the offensive acts of Parliament.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Force, the British Answer.=--Just as the representatives of America
2mo i, 1:were about to present the last petition of Congress to the king on
2mo i, 1:August 23, 1775, George III issued a proclamation of rebellion. This
2mo i, 1:announcement declared that the colonists, "misled by dangerous and
2mo i, 1:ill-designing men," were in a state of insurrection; it called on the
2mo i, 1:civil and military powers to bring "the traitors to justice"; and it
2mo i, 1:threatened with "condign punishment the authors, perpetrators, and
2mo i, 1:abettors of such traitorous designs." It closed with the usual prayer:
2mo i, 1:"God, save the king." Later in the year, Parliament passed a sweeping
2mo i, 1:act destroying all trade and intercourse with America. Congress was
2mo i, 1:silent at last. Force was also America's answer.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Drifting into War.=--Although the Congress had not given up all hope of
2mo i, 1:reconciliation in the spring and summer of 1775, it had firmly resolved
2mo i, 1:to defend American rights by arms if necessary. It transformed the
2mo i, 1:militiamen who had assembled near Boston, after the battle of Lexington,
2mo i, 1:into a Continental army and selected Washington as commander-in-chief.
2mo i, 1:It assumed the powers of a government and prepared to raise money, wage
2mo i, 1:war, and carry on diplomatic relations with foreign countries.

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:SPIRIT OF 1776]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Events followed thick and fast. On June 17, the American militia, by
2mo i, 1:the stubborn defense of Bunker Hill, showed that it could make British
2mo i, 1:regulars pay dearly for all they got. On July 3, Washington took command
2mo i, 1:of the army at Cambridge. In January, 1776, after bitter disappointments
2mo i, 1:in drumming up recruits for its army in England, Scotland, and Ireland,
2mo i, 1:the British government concluded a treaty with the Landgrave of
2mo i, 1:Hesse-Cassel in Germany contracting, at a handsome figure, for thousands
2mo i, 1:of soldiers and many pieces of cannon. This was the crowning insult to
2mo i, 1:America. Such was the view of all friends of the colonies on both sides
2mo i, 1:of the water. Such was, long afterward, the judgment of the conservative
2mo i, 1:historian Lecky: "The conduct of England in hiring German mercenaries to
2mo i, 1:subdue the essentially English population beyond the Atlantic made
2mo i, 1:reconciliation hopeless and independence inevitable." The news of this
2mo i, 1:wretched transaction in German soldiers had hardly reached America
2mo i, 1:before there ran all down the coast the thrilling story that Washington
2mo i, 1:had taken Boston, on March 17, 1776, compelling Lord Howe to sail with
2mo i, 1:his entire army for Halifax.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Growth of Public Sentiment in Favor of Independence.=--Events were
2mo i, 1:bearing the Americans away from their old position under the British
2mo i, 1:constitution toward a final separation. Slowly and against their
2mo i, 1:desires, prudent and honorable men, who cherished the ties that united
2mo i, 1:them to the old order and dreaded with genuine horror all thought of
2mo i, 1:revolution, were drawn into the path that led to the great decision. In
2mo i, 1:all parts of the country and among all classes, the question of the hour
2mo i, 1:was being debated. "American independence," as the historian Bancroft
2mo i, 1:says, "was not an act of sudden passion nor the work of one man or one
2mo i, 1:assembly. It had been discussed in every part of the country by farmers
2mo i, 1:and merchants, by mechanics and planters, by the fishermen along the
2mo i, 1:coast and the backwoodsmen of the West; in town meetings and from the
2mo i, 1:pulpit; at social gatherings and around the camp fires; in county
2mo i, 1:conventions and conferences or committees; in colonial congresses and
2mo i, 1:assemblies."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: _From an old print_
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THOMAS PAINE]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Paine's "Commonsense."=--In the midst of this ferment of American
2mo i, 1:opinion, a bold and eloquent pamphleteer broke in upon the hesitating
2mo i, 1:public with a program for absolute independence, without fears and
2mo i, 1:without apologies. In the early days of 1776, Thomas Paine issued the
2mo i, 1:first of his famous tracts, "Commonsense," a passionate attack upon the
2mo i, 1:British monarchy and an equally passionate plea for American liberty.
2mo i, 1:Casting aside the language of petition with which Americans had hitherto
2mo i, 1:addressed George III, Paine went to the other extreme and assailed him
2mo i, 1:with many a violent epithet. He condemned monarchy itself as a system
2mo i, 1:which had laid the world "in blood and ashes." Instead of praising the
2mo i, 1:British constitution under which colonists had been claiming their
2mo i, 1:rights, he brushed it aside as ridiculous, protesting that it was "owing
2mo i, 1:to the constitution of the people, not to the constitution of the
2mo i, 1:government, that the Crown is not as oppressive in England as in
2mo i, 1:Turkey."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Having thus summarily swept away the grounds of allegiance to the old
2mo i, 1:order, Paine proceeded relentlessly to an argument for immediate
2mo i, 1:separation from Great Britain. There was nothing in the sphere of
2mo i, 1:practical interest, he insisted, which should bind the colonies to the
2mo i, 1:mother country. Allegiance to her had been responsible for the many wars
2mo i, 1:in which they had been involved. Reasons of trade were not less weighty
2mo i, 1:in behalf of independence. "Our corn will fetch its price in any market
2mo i, 1:in Europe and our imported goods must be paid for, buy them where we
2mo i, 1:will." As to matters of government, "it is not in the power of Britain
2mo i, 1:to do this continent justice; the business of it will soon be too
2mo i, 1:weighty and intricate to be managed with any tolerable degree of
2mo i, 1:convenience by a power so distant from us and so very ignorant of us."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:There is accordingly no alternative to independence for America.
2mo i, 1:"Everything that is right or natural pleads for separation. The blood of
2mo i, 1:the slain, the weeping voice of nature cries ''tis time to part.' ...
2mo i, 1:Arms, the last resort, must decide the contest; the appeal was the
2mo i, 1:choice of the king and the continent hath accepted the challenge.... The
2mo i, 1:sun never shone on a cause of greater worth. 'Tis not the affair of a
2mo i, 1:city, a county, a province or a kingdom, but of a continent.... 'Tis not
2mo i, 1:the concern of a day, a year or an age; posterity is involved in the
2mo i, 1:contest and will be more or less affected to the end of time by the
2mo i, 1:proceedings now. Now is the seed-time of Continental union, faith, and
2mo i, 1:honor.... O! ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose not only the
2mo i, 1:tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth.... Let names of Whig and Tory be
2mo i, 1:extinct. Let none other be heard among us than those of a good citizen,
2mo i, 1:an open and resolute friend, and a virtuous supporter of the rights of
2mo i, 1:mankind and of the free and independent states of America." As more than
2mo i, 1:100,000 copies were scattered broadcast over the country, patriots
2mo i, 1:exclaimed with Washington: "Sound doctrine and unanswerable reason!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Drift of Events toward Independence.=--Official support for the
2mo i, 1:idea of independence began to come from many quarters. On the tenth of
2mo i, 1:February, 1776, Gadsden, in the provincial convention of South Carolina,
2mo i, 1:advocated a new constitution for the colony and absolute independence
2mo i, 1:for all America. The convention balked at the latter but went half way
2mo i, 1:by abolishing the system of royal administration and establishing a
2mo i, 1:complete plan of self-government. A month later, on April 12, the
2mo i, 1:neighboring state of North Carolina uttered the daring phrase from which
2mo i, 1:others shrank. It empowered its representatives in the Congress to
2mo i, 1:concur with the delegates of the other colonies in declaring
2mo i, 1:independence. Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Virginia quickly
2mo i, 1:responded to the challenge. The convention of the Old Dominion, on May
2mo i, 1:15, instructed its delegates at Philadelphia to propose the independence
2mo i, 1:of the United Colonies and to give the assent of Virginia to the act of
2mo i, 1:separation. When the resolution was carried the British flag on the
2mo i, 1:state house was lowered for all time.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Meanwhile the Continental Congress was alive to the course of events
2mo i, 1:outside. The subject of independence was constantly being raised. "Are
2mo i, 1:we rebels?" exclaimed Wyeth of Virginia during a debate in February.
2mo i, 1:"No: we must declare ourselves a free people." Others hesitated and
2mo i, 1:spoke of waiting for the arrival of commissioners of conciliation. "Is
2mo i, 1:not America already independent?" asked Samuel Adams a few weeks later.
2mo i, 1:"Why not then declare it?" Still there was uncertainty and delegates
2mo i, 1:avoided the direct word. A few more weeks elapsed. At last, on May 10,
2mo i, 1:Congress declared that the authority of the British crown in America
2mo i, 1:must be suppressed and advised the colonies to set up governments of
2mo i, 1:their own.

2mo i, 1:THOMAS JEFFERSON READING HIS DRAFT OF THE DECLARATION OF
2mo i, 1:INDEPENDENCE TO THE COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Independence Declared.=--The way was fully prepared, therefore, when,
2mo i, 1:on June 7, the Virginia delegation in the Congress moved that "these
2mo i, 1:united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent
2mo i, 1:states." A committee was immediately appointed to draft a formal
2mo i, 1:document setting forth the reasons for the act, and on July 2 all the
2mo i, 1:states save New York went on record in favor of severing their political
2mo i, 1:connection with Great Britain. Two days later, July 4, Jefferson's draft
2mo i, 1:of the Declaration of Independence, changed in some slight particulars,
2mo i, 1:was adopted. The old bell in Independence Hall, as it is now known, rang
2mo i, 1:out the glad tidings; couriers swiftly carried the news to the uttermost
2mo i, 1:hamlet and farm. A new nation announced its will to have a place among
2mo i, 1:the powers of the world.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:To some documents is given immortality. The Declaration of Independence
2mo i, 1:is one of them. American patriotism is forever associated with it; but
2mo i, 1:patriotism alone does not make it immortal. Neither does the vigor of
2mo i, 1:its language or the severity of its indictment give it a secure place in
2mo i, 1:the records of time. The secret of its greatness lies in the simple fact
2mo i, 1:that it is one of the memorable landmarks in the history of a political
2mo i, 1:ideal which for three centuries has been taking form and spreading
2mo i, 1:throughout the earth, challenging kings and potentates, shaking down
2mo i, 1:thrones and aristocracies, breaking the armies of irresponsible power on
2mo i, 1:battle fields as far apart as Marston Moor and Chateau-Thierry. That
2mo i, 1:ideal, now so familiar, then so novel, is summed up in the simple
2mo i, 1:sentence: "Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the
2mo i, 1:governed."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Written in a "decent respect for the opinions of mankind," to set forth
2mo i, 1:the causes which impelled the American colonists to separate from
2mo i, 1:Britain, the Declaration contained a long list of "abuses and
2mo i, 1:usurpations" which had induced them to throw off the government of King
2mo i, 1:George. That section of the Declaration has passed into "ancient"
2mo i, 1:history and is seldom read. It is the part laying down a new basis for
2mo i, 1:government and giving a new dignity to the common man that has become a
2mo i, 1:household phrase in the Old World as in the New.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In the more enduring passages there are four fundamental ideas which,
2mo i, 1:from the standpoint of the old system of government, were the essence of
2mo i, 1:revolution: (1) all men are created equal and are endowed by their
2mo i, 1:Creator with certain unalienable rights including life, liberty, and the
2mo i, 1:pursuit of happiness; (2) the purpose of government is to secure these
2mo i, 1:rights; (3) governments derive their just powers from the consent of the
2mo i, 1:governed; (4) whenever any form of government becomes destructive of
2mo i, 1:these ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and
2mo i, 1:institute new government, laying its foundations on such principles and
2mo i, 1:organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to
2mo i, 1:effect their safety and happiness. Here was the prelude to the historic
2mo i, 1:drama of democracy--a challenge to every form of government and every
2mo i, 1:privilege not founded on popular assent.

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Committees of Correspondence.=--As soon as debate had passed into
2mo i, 1:armed resistance, the patriots found it necessary to consolidate their
2mo i, 1:forces by organizing civil government. This was readily effected, for
2mo i, 1:the means were at hand in town meetings, provincial legislatures, and
2mo i, 1:committees of correspondence. The working tools of the Revolution were
2mo i, 1:in fact the committees of correspondence--small, local, unofficial
2mo i, 1:groups of patriots formed to exchange views and create public sentiment.
2mo i, 1:As early as November, 1772, such a committee had been created in Boston
2mo i, 1:under the leadership of Samuel Adams. It held regular meetings, sent
2mo i, 1:emissaries to neighboring towns, and carried on a campaign of education
2mo i, 1:in the doctrines of liberty.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: THE COLONIES OF NORTH AMERICA AT THE TIME OF THE
2mo i, 1:DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Upon local organizations similar in character to the Boston committee
2mo i, 1:were built county committees and then the larger colonial committees,
2mo i, 1:congresses, and conventions, all unofficial and representing the
2mo i, 1:revolutionary elements. Ordinarily the provincial convention was merely
2mo i, 1:the old legislative assembly freed from all royalist sympathizers and
2mo i, 1:controlled by patriots. Finally, upon these colonial assemblies was
2mo i, 1:built the Continental Congress, the precursor of union under the
2mo i, 1:Articles of Confederation and ultimately under the Constitution of the
2mo i, 1:United States. This was the revolutionary government set up within the
2mo i, 1:British empire in America.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=State Constitutions Framed.=--With the rise of these new assemblies of
2mo i, 1:the people, the old colonial governments broke down. From the royal
2mo i, 1:provinces the governor, the judges, and the high officers fled in haste,
2mo i, 1:and it became necessary to substitute patriot authorities. The appeal to
2mo i, 1:the colonies advising them to adopt a new form of government for
2mo i, 1:themselves, issued by the Congress in May, 1776, was quickly acted upon.
2mo i, 1:Before the expiration of a year, Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
2mo i, 1:Delaware, Maryland, Georgia, and New York had drafted new constitutions
2mo i, 1:as states, not as colonies uncertain of their destinies. Connecticut and
2mo i, 1:Rhode Island, holding that their ancient charters were equal to their
2mo i, 1:needs, merely renounced their allegiance to the king and went on as
2mo i, 1:before so far as the form of government was concerned. South Carolina,
2mo i, 1:which had drafted a temporary plan early in 1776, drew up a new and more
2mo i, 1:complete constitution in 1778. Two years later Massachusetts with much
2mo i, 1:deliberation put into force its fundamental law, which in most of its
2mo i, 1:essential features remains unchanged to-day.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The new state constitutions in their broad outlines followed colonial
2mo i, 1:models. For the royal governor was substituted a governor or president
2mo i, 1:chosen usually by the legislature; but in two instances, New York and
2mo i, 1:Massachusetts, by popular vote. For the provincial council there was
2mo i, 1:substituted, except in Georgia, a senate; while the lower house, or
2mo i, 1:assembly, was continued virtually without change. The old property
2mo i, 1:restriction on the suffrage, though lowered slightly in some states, was
2mo i, 1:continued in full force to the great discontent of the mechanics thus
2mo i, 1:deprived of the ballot. The special qualifications, laid down in several
2mo i, 1:constitutions, for governors, senators, and representatives, indicated
2mo i, 1:that the revolutionary leaders were not prepared for any radical
2mo i, 1:experiments in democracy. The protests of a few women, like Mrs. John
2mo i, 1:Adams of Massachusetts and Mrs. Henry Corbin of Virginia, against a
2mo i, 1:government which excluded them from political rights were treated as
2mo i, 1:mild curiosities of no significance, although in New Jersey women were
2mo i, 1:allowed to vote for many years on the same terms as men.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:By the new state constitutions the signs and symbols of royal power, of
2mo i, 1:authority derived from any source save "the people," were swept aside
2mo i, 1:and republican governments on an imposing scale presented for the first
2mo i, 1:time to the modern world. Copies of these remarkable documents prepared
2mo i, 1:by plain citizens were translated into French and widely circulated in
2mo i, 1:Europe. There they were destined to serve as a guide and inspiration to
2mo i, 1:a generation of constitution-makers whose mission it was to begin the
2mo i, 1:democratic revolution in the Old World.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Articles of Confederation.=--The formation of state constitutions
2mo i, 1:was an easy task for the revolutionary leaders. They had only to build
2mo i, 1:on foundations already laid. The establishment of a national system of
2mo i, 1:government was another matter. There had always been, it must be
2mo i, 1:remembered, a system of central control over the colonies, but Americans
2mo i, 1:had had little experience in its operation. When the supervision of the
2mo i, 1:crown of Great Britain was suddenly broken, the patriot leaders,
2mo i, 1:accustomed merely to provincial statesmanship, were poorly trained for
2mo i, 1:action on a national stage.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Many forces worked against those who, like Franklin, had a vision of
2mo i, 1:national destiny. There were differences in economic interest--commerce
2mo i, 1:and industry in the North and the planting system of the South. There
2mo i, 1:were contests over the apportionment of taxes and the quotas of troops
2mo i, 1:for common defense. To these practical difficulties were added local
2mo i, 1:pride, the vested rights of state and village politicians in their
2mo i, 1:provincial dignity, and the scarcity of men with a large outlook upon
2mo i, 1:the common enterprise.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Nevertheless, necessity compelled them to consider some sort of
2mo i, 1:federation. The second Continental Congress had hardly opened its work
2mo i, 1:before the most sagacious leaders began to urge the desirability of a
2mo i, 1:permanent connection. As early as July, 1775, Congress resolved to go
2mo i, 1:into a committee of the whole on the state of the union, and Franklin,
2mo i, 1:undaunted by the fate of his Albany plan of twenty years before, again
2mo i, 1:presented a draft of a constitution. Long and desultory debates followed
2mo i, 1:and it was not until late in 1777 that Congress presented to the states
2mo i, 1:the Articles of Confederation. Provincial jealousies delayed
2mo i, 1:ratification, and it was the spring of 1781, a few months before the
2mo i, 1:surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, when Maryland, the last of the
2mo i, 1:states, approved the Articles. This plan of union, though it was all
2mo i, 1:that could be wrung from the reluctant states, provided for neither a
2mo i, 1:chief executive nor a system of federal courts. It created simply a
2mo i, 1:Congress of delegates in which each state had an equal voice and gave it
2mo i, 1:the right to call upon the state legislatures for the sinews of
2mo i, 1:government--money and soldiers.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Application of Tests of Allegiance.=--As the successive steps were
2mo i, 1:taken in the direction of independent government, the patriots devised
2mo i, 1:and applied tests designed to discover who were for and who were against
2mo i, 1:the new nation in the process of making. When the first Continental
2mo i, 1:Congress agreed not to allow the importation of British goods, it
2mo i, 1:provided for the creation of local committees to enforce the rules. Such
2mo i, 1:agencies were duly formed by the choice of men favoring the scheme, all
2mo i, 1:opponents being excluded from the elections. Before these bodies those
2mo i, 1:who persisted in buying British goods were summoned and warned or
2mo i, 1:punished according to circumstances. As soon as the new state
2mo i, 1:constitutions were put into effect, local committees set to work in the
2mo i, 1:same way to ferret out all who were not outspoken in their support of
2mo i, 1:the new order of things.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: MOBBING THE TORIES]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:These patriot agencies, bearing different names in different sections,
2mo i, 1:were sometimes ruthless in their methods. They called upon all men to
2mo i, 1:sign the test of loyalty, frequently known as the "association test."
2mo i, 1:Those who refused were promptly branded as outlaws, while some of the
2mo i, 1:more dangerous were thrown into jail. The prison camp in Connecticut at
2mo i, 1:one time held the former governor of New Jersey and the mayor of New
2mo i, 1:York. Thousands were black-listed and subjected to espionage. The
2mo i, 1:black-list of Pennsylvania contained the names of nearly five hundred
2mo i, 1:persons of prominence who were under suspicion. Loyalists or Tories who
2mo i, 1:were bold enough to speak and write against the Revolution were
2mo i, 1:suppressed and their pamphlets burned. In many places, particularly in
2mo i, 1:the North, the property of the loyalists was confiscated and the
2mo i, 1:proceeds applied to the cause of the Revolution.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The work of the official agencies for suppression of opposition was
2mo i, 1:sometimes supplemented by mob violence. A few Tories were hanged without
2mo i, 1:trial, and others were tarred and feathered. One was placed upon a cake
2mo i, 1:of ice and held there "until his loyalty to King George might cool."
2mo i, 1:Whole families were driven out of their homes to find their way as best
2mo i, 1:they could within the British lines or into Canada, where the British
2mo i, 1:government gave them lands. Such excesses were deplored by Washington,
2mo i, 1:but they were defended on the ground that in effect a civil war, as well
2mo i, 1:as a war for independence, was being waged.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Patriots and Tories.=--Thus, by one process or another, those who
2mo i, 1:were to be citizens of the new republic were separated from those who
2mo i, 1:preferred to be subjects of King George. Just what proportion of the
2mo i, 1:Americans favored independence and what share remained loyal to the
2mo i, 1:British monarchy there is no way of knowing. The question of revolution
2mo i, 1:was not submitted to popular vote, and on the point of numbers we have
2mo i, 1:conflicting evidence. On the patriot side, there is the testimony of a
2mo i, 1:careful and informed observer, John Adams, who asserted that two-thirds
2mo i, 1:of the people were for the American cause and not more than one-third
2mo i, 1:opposed the Revolution at all stages.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:On behalf of the loyalists, or Tories as they were popularly known,
2mo i, 1:extravagant claims were made. Joseph Galloway, who had been a member of
2mo i, 1:the first Continental Congress and had fled to England when he saw its
2mo i, 1:temper, testified before a committee of Parliament in 1779 that not
2mo i, 1:one-fifth of the American people supported the insurrection and that
2mo i, 1:"many more than four-fifths of the people prefer a union with Great
2mo i, 1:Britain upon constitutional principles to independence." At the same
2mo i, 1:time General Robertson, who had lived in America twenty-four years,
2mo i, 1:declared that "more than two-thirds of the people would prefer the
2mo i, 1:king's government to the Congress' tyranny." In an address to the king
2mo i, 1:in that year a committee of American loyalists asserted that "the number
2mo i, 1:of Americans in his Majesty's army exceeded the number of troops
2mo i, 1:enlisted by Congress to oppose them."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Character of the Loyalists.=--When General Howe evacuated Boston,
2mo i, 1:more than a thousand people fled with him. This great company, according
2mo i, 1:to a careful historian, "formed the aristocracy of the province by
2mo i, 1:virtue of their official rank; of their dignified callings and
2mo i, 1:professions; of their hereditary wealth and of their culture." The act
2mo i, 1:of banishment passed by Massachusetts in 1778, listing over 300 Tories,
2mo i, 1:"reads like the social register of the oldest and noblest families of
2mo i, 1:New England," more than one out of five being graduates of Harvard
2mo i, 1:College. The same was true of New York and Philadelphia; namely, that
2mo i, 1:the leading loyalists were prominent officials of the old order,
2mo i, 1:clergymen and wealthy merchants. With passion the loyalists fought
2mo i, 1:against the inevitable or with anguish of heart they left as refugees
2mo i, 1:for a life of uncertainty in Canada or the mother country.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Tories Assail the Patriots.=--The Tories who remained in America joined
2mo i, 1:the British army by the thousands or in other ways aided the royal
2mo i, 1:cause. Those who were skillful with the pen assailed the patriots in
2mo i, 1:editorials, rhymes, satires, and political catechisms. They declared
2mo i, 1:that the members of Congress were "obscure, pettifogging attorneys,
2mo i, 1:bankrupt shopkeepers, outlawed smugglers, etc." The people and their
2mo i, 1:leaders they characterized as "wretched banditti ... the refuse and
2mo i, 1:dregs of mankind." The generals in the army they sneered at as "men of
2mo i, 1:rank and honor nearly on a par with those of the Congress."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Patriot Writers Arouse the National Spirit.=--Stung by Tory taunts,
2mo i, 1:patriot writers devoted themselves to creating and sustaining a public
2mo i, 1:opinion favorable to the American cause. Moreover, they had to combat
2mo i, 1:the depression that grew out of the misfortunes in the early days of the
2mo i, 1:war. A terrible disaster befell Generals Arnold and Montgomery in the
2mo i, 1:winter of 1775 as they attempted to bring Canada into the revolution--a
2mo i, 1:disaster that cost 5000 men; repeated calamities harassed Washington in
2mo i, 1:1776 as he was defeated on Long Island, driven out of New York City, and
2mo i, 1:beaten at Harlem Heights and White Plains. These reverses were almost
2mo i, 1:too great for the stoutest patriots.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Pamphleteers, preachers, and publicists rose, however, to meet the needs
2mo i, 1:of the hour. John Witherspoon, provost of the College of New Jersey,
2mo i, 1:forsook the classroom for the field of political controversy. The poet,
2mo i, 1:Philip Freneau, flung taunts of cowardice at the Tories and celebrated
2mo i, 1:the spirit of liberty in many a stirring poem. Songs, ballads, plays,
2mo i, 1:and satires flowed from the press in an unending stream. Fast days,
2mo i, 1:battle anniversaries, celebrations of important steps taken by Congress
2mo i, 1:afforded to patriotic clergymen abundant opportunities for sermons.
2mo i, 1:"Does Mr. Wiberd preach against oppression?" anxiously inquired John
2mo i, 1:Adams in a letter to his wife. The answer was decisive. "The clergy of
2mo i, 1:every denomination, not excepting the Episcopalian, thunder and lighten
2mo i, 1:every Sabbath. They pray for Boston and Massachusetts. They thank God
2mo i, 1:most explicitly and fervently for our remarkable successes. They pray
2mo i, 1:for the American army."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Thomas Paine never let his pen rest. He had been with the forces of
2mo i, 1:Washington when they retreated from Fort Lee and were harried from New
2mo i, 1:Jersey into Pennsylvania. He knew the effect of such reverses on the
2mo i, 1:army as well as on the public. In December, 1776, he made a second great
2mo i, 1:appeal to his countrymen in his pamphlet, "The Crisis," the first part
2mo i, 1:of which he had written while defeat and gloom were all about him. This
2mo i, 1:tract was a cry for continued support of the Revolution. "These are the
2mo i, 1:times that try men's souls," he opened. "The summer soldier and the
2mo i, 1:sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his
2mo i, 1:country; but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of men
2mo i, 1:and women." Paine laid his lash fiercely on the Tories, branding every
2mo i, 1:one as a coward grounded in "servile, slavish, self-interested fear." He
2mo i, 1:deplored the inadequacy of the militia and called for a real army. He
2mo i, 1:refuted the charge that the retreat through New Jersey was a disaster
2mo i, 1:and he promised victory soon. "By perseverance and fortitude," he
2mo i, 1:concluded, "we have the prospect of a glorious issue; by cowardice and
2mo i, 1:submission the sad choice of a variety of evils--a ravaged country, a
2mo i, 1:depopulated city, habitations without safety and slavery without
2mo i, 1:hope.... Look on this picture and weep over it." His ringing call to
2mo i, 1:arms was followed by another and another until the long contest was
2mo i, 1:over.

2mo i, 1:MILITARY AFFAIRS
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Two Phases of the War.=--The war which opened with the battle of
2mo i, 1:Lexington, on April 19, 1775, and closed with the surrender of
2mo i, 1:Cornwallis at Yorktown on October 19, 1781, passed through two distinct
2mo i, 1:phases--the first lasting until the treaty of alliance with France, in
2mo i, 1:1778, and the second until the end of the struggle. During the first
2mo i, 1:phase, the war was confined mainly to the North. The outstanding
2mo i, 1:features of the contest were the evacuation of Boston by the British,
2mo i, 1:the expulsion of American forces from New York and their retreat through
2mo i, 1:New Jersey, the battle of Trenton, the seizure of Philadelphia by the
2mo i, 1:British (September, 1777), the invasion of New York by Burgoyne and his
2mo i, 1:capture at Saratoga in October, 1777, and the encampment of American
2mo i, 1:forces at Valley Forge for the terrible winter of 1777-78.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The final phase of the war, opening with the treaty of alliance with
2mo i, 1:France on February 6, 1778, was confined mainly to the Middle states,
2mo i, 1:the West, and the South. In the first sphere of action the chief events
2mo i, 1:were the withdrawal of the British from Philadelphia, the battle of
2mo i, 1:Monmouth, and the inclosure of the British in New York by deploying
2mo i, 1:American forces from Morristown, New Jersey, up to West Point. In the
2mo i, 1:West, George Rogers Clark, by his famous march into the Illinois
2mo i, 1:country, secured Kaskaskia and Vincennes and laid a firm grip on the
2mo i, 1:country between the Ohio and the Great Lakes. In the South, the second
2mo i, 1:period opened with successes for the British. They captured Savannah,
2mo i, 1:conquered Georgia, and restored the royal governor. In 1780 they seized
2mo i, 1:Charleston, administered a crushing defeat to the American forces under
2mo i, 1:Gates at Camden, and overran South Carolina, though meeting reverses at
2mo i, 1:Cowpens and King's Mountain. Then came the closing scenes. Cornwallis
2mo i, 1:began the last of his operations. He pursued General Greene far into
2mo i, 1:North Carolina, clashed with him at Guilford Court House, retired to the
2mo i, 1:coast, took charge of British forces engaged in plundering Virginia, and
2mo i, 1:fortified Yorktown, where he was penned up by the French fleet from the
2mo i, 1:sea and the combined French and American forces on land.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Geographical Aspects of the War.=--For the British the theater of
2mo i, 1:the war offered many problems. From first to last it extended from
2mo i, 1:Massachusetts to Georgia, a distance of almost a thousand miles. It was
2mo i, 1:nearly three thousand miles from the main base of supplies and, though
2mo i, 1:the British navy kept the channel open, transports were constantly
2mo i, 1:falling prey to daring privateers and fleet American war vessels. The
2mo i, 1:sea, on the other hand, offered an easy means of transportation between
2mo i, 1:points along the coast and gave ready access to the American centers of
2mo i, 1:wealth and population. Of this the British made good use. Though early
2mo i, 1:forced to give up Boston, they seized New York and kept it until the end
2mo i, 1:of the war; they took Philadelphia and retained it until threatened by
2mo i, 1:the approach of the French fleet; and they captured and held both
2mo i, 1:Savannah and Charleston. Wars, however, are seldom won by the conquest
2mo i, 1:of cities.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Particularly was this true in the case of the Revolution. Only a small
2mo i, 1:portion of the American people lived in towns. Countrymen back from the
2mo i, 1:coast were in no way dependent upon them for a livelihood. They lived on
2mo i, 1:the produce of the soil, not upon the profits of trade. This very fact
2mo i, 1:gave strength to them in the contest. Whenever the British ventured far
2mo i, 1:from the ports of entry, they encountered reverses. Burgoyne was forced
2mo i, 1:to surrender at Saratoga because he was surrounded and cut off from his
2mo i, 1:base of supplies. As soon as the British got away from Charleston, they
2mo i, 1:were harassed and worried by the guerrilla warriors of Marion, Sumter,
2mo i, 1:and Pickens. Cornwallis could technically defeat Greene at Guilford far
2mo i, 1:in the interior; but he could not hold the inland region he had invaded.
2mo i, 1:Sustained by their own labor, possessing the interior to which their
2mo i, 1:armies could readily retreat, supplied mainly from native resources, the
2mo i, 1:Americans could not be hemmed in, penned up, and destroyed at one fell
2mo i, 1:blow.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Sea Power.=--The British made good use of their fleet in cutting
2mo i, 1:off American trade, but control of the sea did not seriously affect the
2mo i, 1:United States. As an agricultural country, the ruin of its commerce was
2mo i, 1:not such a vital matter. All the materials for a comfortable though
2mo i, 1:somewhat rude life were right at hand. It made little difference to a
2mo i, 1:nation fighting for existence, if silks, fine linens, and chinaware were
2mo i, 1:cut off. This was an evil to which submission was necessary.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Nor did the brilliant exploits of John Paul Jones and Captain John Barry
2mo i, 1:materially change the situation. They demonstrated the skill of American
2mo i, 1:seamen and their courage as fighting men. They raised the rates of
2mo i, 1:British marine insurance, but they did not dethrone the mistress of the
2mo i, 1:seas. Less spectacular, and more distinctive, were the deeds of the
2mo i, 1:hundreds of privateers and minor captains who overhauled British supply
2mo i, 1:ships and kept British merchantmen in constant anxiety. Not until the
2mo i, 1:French fleet was thrown into the scale, were the British compelled to
2mo i, 1:reckon seriously with the enemy on the sea and make plans based upon the
2mo i, 1:possibilities of a maritime disaster.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Commanding Officers.=--On the score of military leadership it is
2mo i, 1:difficult to compare the contending forces in the revolutionary contest.
2mo i, 1:There is no doubt that all the British commanders were men of experience
2mo i, 1:in the art of warfare. Sir William Howe had served in America during the
2mo i, 1:French War and was accounted an excellent officer, a strict
2mo i, 1:disciplinarian, and a gallant gentleman. Nevertheless he loved ease,
2mo i, 1:society, and good living, and his expulsion from Boston, his failure to
2mo i, 1:overwhelm Washington by sallies from his comfortable bases at New York
2mo i, 1:and Philadelphia, destroyed every shred of his military reputation. John
2mo i, 1:Burgoyne, to whom was given the task of penetrating New York from
2mo i, 1:Canada, had likewise seen service in the French War both in America and
2mo i, 1:Europe. He had, however, a touch of the theatrical in his nature and
2mo i, 1:after the collapse of his plans and the surrender of his army in 1777,
2mo i, 1:he devoted his time mainly to light literature. Sir Henry Clinton, who
2mo i, 1:directed the movement which ended in the capture of Charleston in 1780,
2mo i, 1:had "learned his trade on the continent," and was regarded as a man of
2mo i, 1:discretion and understanding in military matters. Lord Cornwallis, whose
2mo i, 1:achievements at Camden and Guilford were blotted out by his surrender at
2mo i, 1:Yorktown, had seen service in the Seven Years' War and had undoubted
2mo i, 1:talents which he afterward displayed with great credit to himself in
2mo i, 1:India. Though none of them, perhaps, were men of first-rate ability,
2mo i, 1:they all had training and experience to guide them.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: GEORGE WASHINGTON]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The Americans had a host in Washington himself. He had long been
2mo i, 1:interested in military strategy and had tested his coolness under fire
2mo i, 1:during the first clashes with the French nearly twenty years before. He
2mo i, 1:had no doubts about the justice of his cause, such as plagued some of
2mo i, 1:the British generals. He was a stern but reasonable disciplinarian. He
2mo i, 1:was reserved and patient, little given to exaltation at success or
2mo i, 1:depression at reverses. In the dark hour of the Revolution, "what held
2mo i, 1:the patriot forces together?" asks Beveridge in his _Life of John
2mo i, 1:Marshall_. Then he answers: "George Washington and he alone. Had he
2mo i, 1:died or been seriously disabled, the Revolution would have ended....
2mo i, 1:Washington was the soul of the American cause. Washington was the
2mo i, 1:government. Washington was the Revolution." The weakness of Congress in
2mo i, 1:furnishing men and supplies, the indolence of civilians, who lived at
2mo i, 1:ease while the army starved, the intrigues of army officers against him
2mo i, 1:such as the "Conway cabal," the cowardice of Lee at Monmouth, even the
2mo i, 1:treason of Benedict Arnold, while they stirred deep emotions in his
2mo i, 1:breast and aroused him to make passionate pleas to his countrymen, did
2mo i, 1:not shake his iron will or his firm determination to see the war through
2mo i, 1:to the bitter end. The weight of Washington's moral force was
2mo i, 1:immeasurable.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Of the generals who served under him, none can really be said to have
2mo i, 1:been experienced military men when the war opened. Benedict Arnold, the
2mo i, 1:unhappy traitor but brave and daring soldier, was a druggist, book
2mo i, 1:seller, and ship owner at New Haven when the news of Lexington called
2mo i, 1:him to battle. Horatio Gates was looked upon as a "seasoned soldier"
2mo i, 1:because he had entered the British army as a youth, had been wounded at
2mo i, 1:Braddock's memorable defeat, and had served with credit during the Seven
2mo i, 1:Years' War; but he was the most conspicuous failure of the Revolution.
2mo i, 1:The triumph over Burgoyne was the work of other men; and his crushing
2mo i, 1:defeat at Camden put an end to his military pretensions. Nathanael
2mo i, 1:Greene was a Rhode Island farmer and smith without military experience
2mo i, 1:who, when convinced that war was coming, read Caesar's _Commentaries_ and
2mo i, 1:took up the sword. Francis Marion was a shy and modest planter of South
2mo i, 1:Carolina whose sole passage at arms had been a brief but desperate brush
2mo i, 1:with the Indians ten or twelve years earlier. Daniel Morgan, one of the
2mo i, 1:heroes of Cowpens, had been a teamster with Braddock's army and had seen
2mo i, 1:some fighting during the French and Indian War, but his military
2mo i, 1:knowledge, from the point of view of a trained British officer, was
2mo i, 1:negligible. John Sullivan was a successful lawyer at Durham, New
2mo i, 1:Hampshire, and a major in the local militia when duty summoned him to
2mo i, 1:lay down his briefs and take up the sword. Anthony Wayne was a
2mo i, 1:Pennsylvania farmer and land surveyor who, on hearing the clash of arms,
2mo i, 1:read a few books on war, raised a regiment, and offered himself for
2mo i, 1:service. Such is the story of the chief American military leaders, and
2mo i, 1:it is typical of them all. Some had seen fighting with the French and
2mo i, 1:Indians, but none of them had seen warfare on a large scale with regular
2mo i, 1:troops commanded according to the strategy evolved in European
2mo i, 1:experience. Courage, native ability, quickness of mind, and knowledge of
2mo i, 1:the country they had in abundance, and in battles such as were fought
2mo i, 1:during the Revolution all those qualities counted heavily in the
2mo i, 1:balance.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Foreign Officers in American Service.=--To native genius was added
2mo i, 1:military talent from beyond the seas. Baron Steuben, well schooled in
2mo i, 1:the iron regime of Frederick the Great, came over from Prussia, joined
2mo i, 1:Washington at Valley Forge, and day after day drilled and manoeuvered the
2mo i, 1:men, laughing and cursing as he turned raw countrymen into regular
2mo i, 1:soldiers. From France came young Lafayette and the stern De Kalb, from
2mo i, 1:Poland came Pulaski and Kosciusko;--all acquainted with the arts of war
2mo i, 1:as waged in Europe and fitted for leadership as well as teaching.
2mo i, 1:Lafayette came early, in 1776, in a ship of his own, accompanied by
2mo i, 1:several officers of wide experience, and remained loyally throughout the
2mo i, 1:war sharing the hardships of American army life. Pulaski fell at the
2mo i, 1:siege of Savannah and De Kalb at Camden. Kosciusko survived the American
2mo i, 1:war to defend in vain the independence of his native land. To these
2mo i, 1:distinguished foreigners, who freely threw in their lot with American
2mo i, 1:revolutionary fortunes, was due much of that spirit and discipline which
2mo i, 1:fitted raw recruits and temperamental militiamen to cope with a military
2mo i, 1:power of the first rank.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Soldiers.=--As far as the British soldiers were concerned their
2mo i, 1:annals are short and simple. The regulars from the standing army who
2mo i, 1:were sent over at the opening of the contest, the recruits drummed up
2mo i, 1:by special efforts at home, and the thousands of Hessians bought
2mo i, 1:outright by King George presented few problems of management to the
2mo i, 1:British officers. These common soldiers were far away from home and
2mo i, 1:enlisted for the war. Nearly all of them were well disciplined and many
2mo i, 1:of them experienced in actual campaigns. The armies of King George
2mo i, 1:fought bravely, as the records of Bunker Hill, Brandywine, and Monmouth
2mo i, 1:demonstrate. Many a man and subordinate officer and, for that matter,
2mo i, 1:some of the high officers expressed a reluctance at fighting against
2mo i, 1:their own kin; but they obeyed orders.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The Americans, on the other hand, while they fought with grim
2mo i, 1:determination, as men fighting for their homes, were lacking in
2mo i, 1:discipline and in the experience of regular troops. When the war broke
2mo i, 1:in upon them, there were no common preparations for it. There was no
2mo i, 1:continental army; there were only local bands of militiamen, many of
2mo i, 1:them experienced in fighting but few of them "regulars" in the military
2mo i, 1:sense. Moreover they were volunteers serving for a short time,
2mo i, 1:unaccustomed to severe discipline, and impatient at the restraints
2mo i, 1:imposed on them by long and arduous campaigns. They were continually
2mo i, 1:leaving the service just at the most critical moments. "The militia,"
2mo i, 1:lamented Washington, "come in, you cannot tell how; go, you cannot tell
2mo i, 1:where; consume your provisions; exhaust your stores; and leave you at
2mo i, 1:last at a critical moment."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Again and again Washington begged Congress to provide for an army of
2mo i, 1:regulars enlisted for the war, thoroughly trained and paid according to
2mo i, 1:some definite plan. At last he was able to overcome, in part at least,
2mo i, 1:the chronic fear of civilians in Congress and to wring from that
2mo i, 1:reluctant body an agreement to grant half pay to all officers and a
2mo i, 1:bonus to all privates who served until the end of the war. Even this
2mo i, 1:scheme, which Washington regarded as far short of justice to the
2mo i, 1:soldiers, did not produce quick results. It was near the close of the
2mo i, 1:conflict before he had an army of well-disciplined veterans capable of
2mo i, 1:meeting British regulars on equal terms.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Though there were times when militiamen and frontiersmen did valiant and
2mo i, 1:effective work, it is due to historical accuracy to deny the
2mo i, 1:time-honored tradition that a few minutemen overwhelmed more numerous
2mo i, 1:forces of regulars in a seven years' war for independence. They did
2mo i, 1:nothing of the sort. For the victories of Bennington, Trenton, Saratoga,
2mo i, 1:and Yorktown there were the defeats of Bunker Hill, Long Island, White
2mo i, 1:Plains, Germantown, and Camden. Not once did an army of militiamen
2mo i, 1:overcome an equal number of British regulars in an open trial by battle.
2mo i, 1:"To bring men to be well acquainted with the duties of a soldier," wrote
2mo i, 1:Washington, "requires time.... To expect the same service from raw and
2mo i, 1:undisciplined recruits as from veteran soldiers is to expect what never
2mo i, 1:did and perhaps never will happen."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=How the War Was Won.=--Then how did the American army win the war? For
2mo i, 1:one thing there were delays and blunders on the part of the British
2mo i, 1:generals who, in 1775 and 1776, dallied in Boston and New York with
2mo i, 1:large bodies of regular troops when they might have been dealing
2mo i, 1:paralyzing blows at the scattered bands that constituted the American
2mo i, 1:army. "Nothing but the supineness or folly of the enemy could have saved
2mo i, 1:us," solemnly averred Washington in 1780. Still it is fair to say that
2mo i, 1:this apparent supineness was not all due to the British generals. The
2mo i, 1:ministers behind them believed that a large part of the colonists were
2mo i, 1:loyal and that compromise would be promoted by inaction rather than by a
2mo i, 1:war vigorously prosecuted. Victory by masterly inactivity was obviously
2mo i, 1:better than conquest, and the slighter the wounds the quicker the
2mo i, 1:healing. Later in the conflict when the seasoned forces of France were
2mo i, 1:thrown into the scale, the Americans themselves had learned many things
2mo i, 1:about the practical conduct of campaigns. All along, the British were
2mo i, 1:embarrassed by the problem of supplies. Their troops could not forage
2mo i, 1:with the skill of militiamen, as they were in unfamiliar territory. The
2mo i, 1:long oversea voyages were uncertain at best and doubly so when the
2mo i, 1:warships of France joined the American privateers in preying on supply
2mo i, 1:boats.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The British were in fact battered and worn down by a guerrilla war and
2mo i, 1:outdone on two important occasions by superior forces--at Saratoga and
2mo i, 1:Yorktown. Stern facts convinced them finally that an immense army, which
2mo i, 1:could be raised only by a supreme effort, would be necessary to subdue
2mo i, 1:the colonies if that hazardous enterprise could be accomplished at all.
2mo i, 1:They learned also that America would then be alienated, fretful, and the
2mo i, 1:scene of endless uprisings calling for an army of occupation. That was a
2mo i, 1:price which staggered even Lord North and George III. Moreover, there
2mo i, 1:were forces of opposition at home with which they had to reckon.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Women and the War.=--At no time were the women of America indifferent
2mo i, 1:to the struggle for independence. When it was confined to the realm of
2mo i, 1:opinion they did their part in creating public sentiment. Mrs. Elizabeth
2mo i, 1:Timothee, for example, founded in Charleston, in 1773, a newspaper to
2mo i, 1:espouse the cause of the province. Far to the north the sister of James
2mo i, 1:Otis, Mrs. Mercy Warren, early begged her countrymen to rest their case
2mo i, 1:upon their natural rights, and in influential circles she urged the
2mo i, 1:leaders to stand fast by their principles. While John Adams was tossing
2mo i, 1:about with uncertainty at the Continental Congress, his wife was writing
2mo i, 1:letters to him declaring her faith in "independency."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:When the war came down upon the country, women helped in every field. In
2mo i, 1:sustaining public sentiment they were active. Mrs. Warren with a
2mo i, 1:tireless pen combatted loyalist propaganda in many a drama and satire.
2mo i, 1:Almost every revolutionary leader had a wife or daughter who rendered
2mo i, 1:service in the "second line of defense." Mrs. Washington managed the
2mo i, 1:plantation while the General was at the front and went north to face the
2mo i, 1:rigors of the awful winter at Valley Forge--an inspiration to her
2mo i, 1:husband and his men. The daughter of Benjamin Franklin, Mrs. Sarah
2mo i, 1:Bache, while her father was pleading the American cause in France, set
2mo i, 1:the women of Pennsylvania to work sewing and collecting supplies. Even
2mo i, 1:near the firing line women were to be found, aiding the wounded, hauling
2mo i, 1:powder to the front, and carrying dispatches at the peril of their
2mo i, 1:lives.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In the economic sphere, the work of women was invaluable. They harvested
2mo i, 1:crops without enjoying the picturesque title of "farmerettes" and they
2mo i, 1:canned and preserved for the wounded and the prisoners of war. Of their
2mo i, 1:labor in spinning and weaving it is recorded: "Immediately on being cut
2mo i, 1:off from the use of English manufactures, the women engaged within their
2mo i, 1:own families in manufacturing various kinds of cloth for domestic use.
2mo i, 1:They thus kept their households decently clad and the surplus of their
2mo i, 1:labors they sold to such as chose to buy rather than make for
2mo i, 1:themselves. In this way the female part of families by their industry
2mo i, 1:and strict economy frequently supported the whole domestic circle,
2mo i, 1:evincing the strength of their attachment and the value of their
2mo i, 1:service."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:For their war work, women were commended by high authorities on more
2mo i, 1:than one occasion. They were given medals and public testimonials even
2mo i, 1:as in our own day. Washington thanked them for their labors and paid
2mo i, 1:tribute to them for the inspiration and material aid which they had
2mo i, 1:given to the cause of independence.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE FINANCES OF THE REVOLUTION
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:When the Revolution opened, there were thirteen little treasuries in
2mo i, 1:America but no common treasury, and from first to last the Congress was
2mo i, 1:in the position of a beggar rather than a sovereign. Having no authority
2mo i, 1:to lay and collect taxes directly and knowing the hatred of the
2mo i, 1:provincials for taxation, it resorted mainly to loans and paper money to
2mo i, 1:finance the war. "Do you think," boldly inquired one of the delegates,
2mo i, 1:"that I will consent to load my constituents with taxes when we can send
2mo i, 1:to the printer and get a wagon load of money, one quire of which will
2mo i, 1:pay for the whole?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Paper Money and Loans.=--Acting on this curious but appealing political
2mo i, 1:economy, Congress issued in June, 1776, two million dollars in bills of
2mo i, 1:credit to be redeemed by the states on the basis of their respective
2mo i, 1:populations. Other issues followed in quick succession. In all about
2mo i, 1:$241,000,000 of continental paper was printed, to which the several
2mo i, 1:states added nearly $210,000,000 of their own notes. Then came
2mo i, 1:interest-bearing bonds in ever increasing quantities. Several millions
2mo i, 1:were also borrowed from France and small sums from Holland and Spain. In
2mo i, 1:desperation a national lottery was held, producing meager results. The
2mo i, 1:property of Tories was confiscated and sold, bringing in about
2mo i, 1:$16,000,000. Begging letters were sent to the states asking them to
2mo i, 1:raise revenues for the continental treasury, but the states, burdened
2mo i, 1:with their own affairs, gave little heed.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Inflation and Depreciation.=--As paper money flowed from the press, it
2mo i, 1:rapidly declined in purchasing power until in 1779 a dollar was worth
2mo i, 1:only two or three cents in gold or silver. Attempts were made by
2mo i, 1:Congress and the states to compel people to accept the notes at face
2mo i, 1:value; but these were like attempts to make water flow uphill.
2mo i, 1:Speculators collected at once to fatten on the calamities of the
2mo i, 1:republic. Fortunes were made and lost gambling on the prices of public
2mo i, 1:securities while the patriot army, half clothed, was freezing at Valley
2mo i, 1:Forge. "Speculation, peculation, engrossing, forestalling," exclaimed
2mo i, 1:Washington, "afford too many melancholy proofs of the decay of public
2mo i, 1:virtue. Nothing, I am convinced, but the depreciation of our currency
2mo i, 1:... aided by stock jobbing and party dissensions has fed the hopes of
2mo i, 1:the enemy."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Patriot Financiers.=--To the efforts of Congress in financing the
2mo i, 1:war were added the labors of private citizens. Hayn Solomon, a merchant
2mo i, 1:of Philadelphia, supplied members of Congress, including Madison,
2mo i, 1:Jefferson, and Monroe, and army officers, like Lee and Steuben, with
2mo i, 1:money for their daily needs. All together he contributed the huge sum of
2mo i, 1:half a million dollars to the American cause and died broken in purse,
2mo i, 1:if not in spirit, a British prisoner of war. Another Philadelphia
2mo i, 1:merchant, Robert Morris, won for himself the name of the "patriot
2mo i, 1:financier" because he labored night and day to find the money to meet
2mo i, 1:the bills which poured in upon the bankrupt government. When his own
2mo i, 1:funds were exhausted, he borrowed from his friends. Experienced in the
2mo i, 1:handling of merchandise, he created agencies at important points to
2mo i, 1:distribute supplies to the troops, thus displaying administrative as
2mo i, 1:well as financial talents.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: ROBERT MORRIS]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Women organized "drives" for money, contributed their plate and their
2mo i, 1:jewels, and collected from door to door. Farmers took worthless paper in
2mo i, 1:return for their produce, and soldiers saw many a pay day pass without
2mo i, 1:yielding them a penny. Thus by the labors and sacrifices of citizens,
2mo i, 1:the issuance of paper money, lotteries, the floating of loans,
2mo i, 1:borrowings in Europe, and the impressment of supplies, the Congress
2mo i, 1:staggered through the Revolution like a pauper who knows not how his
2mo i, 1:next meal is to be secured but is continuously relieved at a crisis by a
2mo i, 1:kindly fate.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE DIPLOMACY OF THE REVOLUTION
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:When the full measure of honor is given to the soldiers and sailors and
2mo i, 1:their commanding officers, the civilians who managed finances and
2mo i, 1:supplies, the writers who sustained the American spirit, and the women
2mo i, 1:who did well their part, there yet remains the duty of recognizing the
2mo i, 1:achievements of diplomacy. The importance of this field of activity was
2mo i, 1:keenly appreciated by the leaders in the Continental Congress. They were
2mo i, 1:fairly well versed in European history. They knew of the balance of
2mo i, 1:power and the sympathies, interests, and prejudices of nations and their
2mo i, 1:rulers. All this information they turned to good account, in opening
2mo i, 1:relations with continental countries and seeking money, supplies, and
2mo i, 1:even military assistance. For the transaction of this delicate business,
2mo i, 1:they created a secret committee on foreign correspondence as early as
2mo i, 1:1775 and prepared to send agents abroad.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=American Agents Sent Abroad.=--Having heard that France was inclining a
2mo i, 1:friendly ear to the American cause, the Congress, in March, 1776, sent a
2mo i, 1:commissioner to Paris, Silas Deane of Connecticut, often styled the
2mo i, 1:"first American diplomat." Later in the year a form of treaty to be
2mo i, 1:presented to foreign powers was drawn up, and Franklin, Arthur Lee, and
2mo i, 1:Deane were selected as American representatives at the court of "His
2mo i, 1:Most Christian Majesty the King of France." John Jay of New York was
2mo i, 1:chosen minister to Spain in 1779; John Adams was sent to Holland the
2mo i, 1:same year; and other agents were dispatched to Florence, Vienna, and
2mo i, 1:Berlin. The representative selected for St. Petersburg spent two
2mo i, 1:fruitless years there, "ignored by the court, living in obscurity and
2mo i, 1:experiencing nothing but humiliation and failure." Frederick the Great,
2mo i, 1:king of Prussia, expressed a desire to find in America a market for
2mo i, 1:Silesian linens and woolens, but, fearing England's command of the sea,
2mo i, 1:he refused to give direct aid to the Revolutionary cause.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Early French Interest.=--The great diplomatic triumph of the Revolution
2mo i, 1:was won at Paris, and Benjamin Franklin was the hero of the occasion,
2mo i, 1:although many circumstances prepared the way for his success. Louis
2mo i, 1:XVI's foreign minister, Count de Vergennes, before the arrival of any
2mo i, 1:American representative, had brought to the attention of the king the
2mo i, 1:opportunity offered by the outbreak of the war between England and her
2mo i, 1:colonies. He showed him how France could redress her grievances and
2mo i, 1:"reduce the power and greatness of England"--the empire that in 1763 had
2mo i, 1:forced upon her a humiliating peace "at the price of our possessions,
2mo i, 1:of our commerce, and our credit in the Indies, at the price of Canada,
2mo i, 1:Louisiana, Isle Royale, Acadia, and Senegal." Equally successful in
2mo i, 1:gaining the king's interest was a curious French adventurer,
2mo i, 1:Beaumarchais, a man of wealth, a lover of music, and the author of two
2mo i, 1:popular plays, "Figaro" and "The Barber of Seville." These two men had
2mo i, 1:already urged upon the king secret aid for America before Deane appeared
2mo i, 1:on the scene. Shortly after his arrival they made confidential
2mo i, 1:arrangements to furnish money, clothing, powder, and other supplies to
2mo i, 1:the struggling colonies, although official requests for them were
2mo i, 1:officially refused by the French government.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Franklin at Paris.=--When Franklin reached Paris, he was received only
2mo i, 1:in private by the king's minister, Vergennes. The French people,
2mo i, 1:however, made manifest their affection for the "plain republican" in
2mo i, 1:"his full dress suit of spotted Manchester velvet." He was known among
2mo i, 1:men of letters as an author, a scientist, and a philosopher of
2mo i, 1:extraordinary ability. His "Poor Richard" had thrice been translated
2mo i, 1:into French and was scattered in numerous editions throughout the
2mo i, 1:kingdom. People of all ranks--ministers, ladies at court, philosophers,
2mo i, 1:peasants, and stable boys--knew of Franklin and wished him success in
2mo i, 1:his mission. The queen, Marie Antoinette, fated to lose her head in a
2mo i, 1:revolution soon to follow, played with fire by encouraging "our dear
2mo i, 1:republican."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:For the king of France, however, this was more serious business. England
2mo i, 1:resented the presence of this "traitor" in Paris, and Louis had to be
2mo i, 1:cautious about plunging into another war that might also end
2mo i, 1:disastrously. Moreover, the early period of Franklin's sojourn in Paris
2mo i, 1:was a dark hour for the American Revolution. Washington's brilliant
2mo i, 1:exploit at Trenton on Christmas night, 1776, and the battle with
2mo i, 1:Cornwallis at Princeton had been followed by the disaster at Brandywine,
2mo i, 1:the loss of Philadelphia, the defeat at Germantown, and the retirement
2mo i, 1:to Valley Forge for the winter of 1777-78. New York City and
2mo i, 1:Philadelphia--two strategic ports--were in British hands; the Hudson
2mo i, 1:and Delaware rivers were blocked; and General Burgoyne with his British
2mo i, 1:troops was on his way down through the heart of northern New York,
2mo i, 1:cutting New England off from the rest of the colonies. No wonder the
2mo i, 1:king was cautious. Then the unexpected happened. Burgoyne, hemmed in
2mo i, 1:from all sides by the American forces, his flanks harried, his foraging
2mo i, 1:parties beaten back, his supplies cut off, surrendered on October 17,
2mo i, 1:1777, to General Gates, who had superseded General Schuyler in time to
2mo i, 1:receive the honor.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Treaties of Alliance and Commerce (1778).=--News of this victory,
2mo i, 1:placed by historians among the fifteen decisive battles of the world,
2mo i, 1:reached Franklin one night early in December while he and some friends
2mo i, 1:sat gloomily at dinner. Beaumarchais, who was with him, grasped at once
2mo i, 1:the meaning of the situation and set off to the court at Versailles with
2mo i, 1:such haste that he upset his coach and dislocated his arm. The king and
2mo i, 1:his ministers were at last convinced that the hour had come to aid the
2mo i, 1:Revolution. Treaties of commerce and alliance were drawn up and signed
2mo i, 1:in February, 1778. The independence of the United States was recognized
2mo i, 1:by France and an alliance was formed to guarantee that independence.
2mo i, 1:Combined military action was agreed upon and Louis then formally
2mo i, 1:declared war on England. Men who had, a few short years before, fought
2mo i, 1:one another in the wilderness of Pennsylvania or on the Plains of
2mo i, 1:Abraham, were now ranged side by side in a war on the Empire that Pitt
2mo i, 1:had erected and that George III was pulling down.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Spain and Holland Involved.=--Within a few months, Spain, remembering
2mo i, 1:the steady decline of her sea power since the days of the Armada and
2mo i, 1:hoping to drive the British out of Gibraltar, once more joined the
2mo i, 1:concert of nations against England. Holland, a member of a league of
2mo i, 1:armed neutrals formed in protest against British searches on the high
2mo i, 1:seas, sent her fleet to unite with the forces of Spain, France, and
2mo i, 1:America to prey upon British commerce. To all this trouble for England
2mo i, 1:was added the danger of a possible revolt in Ireland, where the spirit
2mo i, 1:of independence was flaming up.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The British Offer Terms to America.=--Seeing the colonists about to be
2mo i, 1:joined by France in a common war on the English empire, Lord North
2mo i, 1:proposed, in February, 1778, a renewal of negotiations. By solemn
2mo i, 1:enactment, Parliament declared its intention not to exercise the right
2mo i, 1:of imposing taxes within the colonies; at the same time it authorized
2mo i, 1:the opening of negotiations through commissioners to be sent to America.
2mo i, 1:A truce was to be established, pardons granted, objectionable laws
2mo i, 1:suspended, and the old imperial constitution, as it stood before the
2mo i, 1:opening of hostilities, restored to full vigor. It was too late. Events
2mo i, 1:had taken the affairs of America out of the hands of British
2mo i, 1:commissioners and diplomats.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Effects of French Aid.=--The French alliance brought ships of war,
2mo i, 1:large sums of gold and silver, loads of supplies, and a considerable
2mo i, 1:body of trained soldiers to the aid of the Americans. Timely as was this
2mo i, 1:help, it meant no sudden change in the fortunes of war. The British
2mo i, 1:evacuated Philadelphia in the summer following the alliance, and
2mo i, 1:Washington's troops were encouraged to come out of Valley Forge. They
2mo i, 1:inflicted a heavy blow on the British at Monmouth, but the treasonable
2mo i, 1:conduct of General Charles Lee prevented a triumph. The recovery of
2mo i, 1:Philadelphia was offset by the treason of Benedict Arnold, the loss of
2mo i, 1:Savannah and Charleston (1780), and the defeat of Gates at Camden.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The full effect of the French alliance was not felt until 1781, when
2mo i, 1:Cornwallis went into Virginia and settled at Yorktown. Accompanied by
2mo i, 1:French troops Washington swept rapidly southward and penned the British
2mo i, 1:to the shore while a powerful French fleet shut off their escape by sea.
2mo i, 1:It was this movement, which certainly could not have been executed
2mo i, 1:without French aid, that put an end to all chance of restoring British
2mo i, 1:dominion in America. It was the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown that
2mo i, 1:caused Lord North to pace the floor and cry out: "It is all over! It is
2mo i, 1:all over!" What might have been done without the French alliance lies
2mo i, 1:hidden from mankind. What was accomplished with the help of French
2mo i, 1:soldiers, sailors, officers, money, and supplies, is known to all the
2mo i, 1:earth. "All the world agree," exultantly wrote Franklin from Paris to
2mo i, 1:General Washington, "that no expedition was ever better planned or
2mo i, 1:better executed. It brightens the glory that must accompany your name to
2mo i, 1:the latest posterity." Diplomacy as well as martial valor had its
2mo i, 1:reward.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:PEACE AT LAST
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=British Opposition to the War.=--In measuring the forces that led to
2mo i, 1:the final discomfiture of King George and Lord North, it is necessary to
2mo i, 1:remember that from the beginning to the end the British ministry at home
2mo i, 1:faced a powerful, informed, and relentless opposition. There were
2mo i, 1:vigorous protests, first against the obnoxious acts which precipitated
2mo i, 1:the unhappy quarrel, then against the way in which the war was waged,
2mo i, 1:and finally against the futile struggle to retain a hold upon the
2mo i, 1:American dominions. Among the members of Parliament who thundered
2mo i, 1:against the government were the first statesmen and orators of the land.
2mo i, 1:William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, though he deplored the idea of American
2mo i, 1:independence, denounced the government as the aggressor and rejoiced in
2mo i, 1:American resistance. Edmund Burke leveled his heavy batteries against
2mo i, 1:every measure of coercion and at last strove for a peace which, while
2mo i, 1:giving independence to America, would work for reconciliation rather
2mo i, 1:than estrangement. Charles James Fox gave the colonies his generous
2mo i, 1:sympathy and warmly championed their rights. Outside of the circle of
2mo i, 1:statesmen there were stout friends of the American cause like David
2mo i, 1:Hume, the philosopher and historian, and Catherine Macaulay, an author
2mo i, 1:of wide fame and a republican bold enough to encourage Washington in
2mo i, 1:seeing it through.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Against this powerful opposition, the government enlisted a whole army
2mo i, 1:of scribes and journalists to pour out criticism on the Americans and
2mo i, 1:their friends. Dr. Samuel Johnson, whom it employed in this business,
2mo i, 1:was so savage that even the ministers had to tone down his pamphlets
2mo i, 1:before printing them. Far more weighty was Edward Gibbon, who was in
2mo i, 1:time to win fame as the historian of the _Decline and Fall of the Roman
2mo i, 1:Empire_. He had at first opposed the government; but, on being given a
2mo i, 1:lucrative post, he used his sharp pen in its support, causing his
2mo i, 1:friends to ridicule him in these lines:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:    "King George, in a fright
2mo i, 1:     Lest Gibbon should write
2mo i, 1:       The story of England's disgrace,
2mo i, 1:     Thought no way so sure
2mo i, 1:     His pen to secure
2mo i, 1:       As to give the historian a place."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Lord North Yields.=--As time wore on, events bore heavily on the side
2mo i, 1:of the opponents of the government's measures. They had predicted that
2mo i, 1:conquest was impossible, and they had urged the advantages of a peace
2mo i, 1:which would in some measure restore the affections of the Americans.
2mo i, 1:Every day's news confirmed their predictions and lent support to their
2mo i, 1:arguments. Moreover, the war, which sprang out of an effort to relieve
2mo i, 1:English burdens, made those burdens heavier than ever. Military expenses
2mo i, 1:were daily increasing. Trade with the colonies, the greatest single
2mo i, 1:outlet for British goods and capital, was paralyzed. The heavy debts due
2mo i, 1:British merchants in America were not only unpaid but postponed into an
2mo i, 1:indefinite future. Ireland was on the verge of revolution. The French
2mo i, 1:had a dangerous fleet on the high seas. In vain did the king assert in
2mo i, 1:December, 1781, that no difficulties would ever make him consent to a
2mo i, 1:peace that meant American independence. Parliament knew better, and on
2mo i, 1:February 27, 1782, in the House of Commons was carried an address to the
2mo i, 1:throne against continuing the war. Burke, Fox, the younger Pitt, Barre,
2mo i, 1:and other friends of the colonies voted in the affirmative. Lord North
2mo i, 1:gave notice then that his ministry was at an end. The king moaned:
2mo i, 1:"Necessity made me yield."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In April, 1782, Franklin received word from the English government that
2mo i, 1:it was prepared to enter into negotiations leading to a settlement. This
2mo i, 1:was embarrassing. In the treaty of alliance with France, the United
2mo i, 1:States had promised that peace should be a joint affair agreed to by
2mo i, 1:both nations in open conference. Finding France, however, opposed to
2mo i, 1:some of their claims respecting boundaries and fisheries, the American
2mo i, 1:commissioners conferred with the British agents at Paris without
2mo i, 1:consulting the French minister. They actually signed a preliminary peace
2mo i, 1:draft before they informed him of their operations. When Vergennes
2mo i, 1:reproached him, Franklin replied that they "had been guilty of
2mo i, 1:neglecting _bienseance_ [good manners] but hoped that the great work
2mo i, 1:would not be ruined by a single indiscretion."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Terms of Peace (1783).=--The general settlement at Paris in 1783
2mo i, 1:was a triumph for America. England recognized the independence of the
2mo i, 1:United States, naming each state specifically, and agreed to boundaries
2mo i, 1:extending from the Atlantic to the Mississippi and from the Great Lakes
2mo i, 1:to the Floridas. England held Canada, Newfoundland, and the West Indies
2mo i, 1:intact, made gains in India, and maintained her supremacy on the seas.
2mo i, 1:Spain won Florida and Minorca but not the coveted Gibraltar. France
2mo i, 1:gained nothing important save the satisfaction of seeing England humbled
2mo i, 1:and the colonies independent.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The generous terms secured by the American commission at Paris called
2mo i, 1:forth surprise and gratitude in the United States and smoothed the way
2mo i, 1:for a renewal of commercial relations with the mother country. At the
2mo i, 1:same time they gave genuine anxiety to European diplomats. "This federal
2mo i, 1:republic is born a pigmy," wrote the Spanish ambassador to his royal
2mo i, 1:master. "A day will come when it will be a giant; even a colossus
2mo i, 1:formidable to these countries. Liberty of conscience and the facility
2mo i, 1:for establishing a new population on immense lands, as well as the
2mo i, 1:advantages of the new government, will draw thither farmers and artisans
2mo i, 1:from all the nations. In a few years we shall watch with grief the
2mo i, 1:tyrannical existence of the same colossus."

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:SUMMARY OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The independence of the American colonies was foreseen by many European
2mo i, 1:statesmen as they watched the growth of their population, wealth, and
2mo i, 1:power; but no one could fix the hour of the great event. Until 1763 the
2mo i, 1:American colonists lived fairly happily under British dominion. There
2mo i, 1:were collisions from time to time, of course. Royal governors clashed
2mo i, 1:with stiff-necked colonial legislatures. There were protests against the
2mo i, 1:exercise of the king's veto power in specific cases. Nevertheless, on
2mo i, 1:the whole, the relations between America and the mother country were
2mo i, 1:more amicable in 1763 than at any period under the Stuart regime which
2mo i, 1:closed in 1688.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The crash, when it came, was not deliberately willed by any one. It was
2mo i, 1:the product of a number of forces that happened to converge about 1763.
2mo i, 1:Three years before, there had come to the throne George III, a young,
2mo i, 1:proud, inexperienced, and stubborn king. For nearly fifty years his
2mo i, 1:predecessors, Germans as they were in language and interest, had allowed
2mo i, 1:things to drift in England and America. George III decided that he would
2mo i, 1:be king in fact as well as in name. About the same time England brought
2mo i, 1:to a close the long and costly French and Indian War and was staggering
2mo i, 1:under a heavy burden of debt and taxes. The war had been fought partly
2mo i, 1:in defense of the American colonies and nothing seemed more reasonable
2mo i, 1:to English statesmen than the idea that the colonies should bear part of
2mo i, 1:the cost of their own defense. At this juncture there came into
2mo i, 1:prominence, in royal councils, two men bent on taxing America and
2mo i, 1:controlling her trade, Grenville and Townshend. The king was willing,
2mo i, 1:the English taxpayers were thankful for any promise of relief, and
2mo i, 1:statesmen were found to undertake the experiment. England therefore set
2mo i, 1:out upon a new course. She imposed taxes upon the colonists, regulated
2mo i, 1:their trade and set royal officers upon them to enforce the law. This
2mo i, 1:action evoked protests from the colonists. They held a Stamp Act
2mo i, 1:Congress to declare their rights and petition for a redress of
2mo i, 1:grievances. Some of the more restless spirits rioted in the streets,
2mo i, 1:sacked the houses of the king's officers, and tore up the stamped paper.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Frightened by uprising, the English government drew back and repealed
2mo i, 1:the Stamp Act. Then it veered again and renewed its policy of
2mo i, 1:interference. Interference again called forth American protests.
2mo i, 1:Protests aroused sharper retaliation. More British regulars were sent
2mo i, 1:over to keep order. More irritating laws were passed by Parliament.
2mo i, 1:Rioting again appeared: tea was dumped in the harbor of Boston and
2mo i, 1:seized in the harbor of Charleston. The British answer was more force.
2mo i, 1:The response of the colonists was a Continental Congress for defense. An
2mo i, 1:unexpected and unintended clash of arms at Lexington and Concord in the
2mo i, 1:spring of 1775 brought forth from the king of England a proclamation:
2mo i, 1:"The Americans are rebels!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The die was cast. The American Revolution had begun. Washington was made
2mo i, 1:commander-in-chief. Armies were raised, money was borrowed, a huge
2mo i, 1:volume of paper currency was issued, and foreign aid was summoned.
2mo i, 1:Franklin plied his diplomatic arts at Paris until in 1778 he induced
2mo i, 1:France to throw her sword into the balance. Three years later,
2mo i, 1:Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown. In 1783, by the formal treaty of
2mo i, 1:peace, George III acknowledged the independence of the United States.
2mo i, 1:The new nation, endowed with an imperial domain stretching from the
2mo i, 1:Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River, began its career among the
2mo i, 1:sovereign powers of the earth.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In the sphere of civil government, the results of the Revolution were
2mo i, 1:equally remarkable. Royal officers and royal authorities were driven
2mo i, 1:from the former dominions. All power was declared to be in the people.
2mo i, 1:All the colonies became states, each with its own constitution or plan
2mo i, 1:of government. The thirteen states were united in common bonds under the
2mo i, 1:Articles of Confederation. A republic on a large scale was instituted.
2mo i, 1:Thus there was begun an adventure in popular government such as the
2mo i, 1:world had never seen. Could it succeed or was it destined to break down
2mo i, 1:and be supplanted by a monarchy? The fate of whole continents hung upon
2mo i, 1:the answer.

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE FORMATION OF THE CONSTITUTION
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE PROMISE AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF AMERICA
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The rise of a young republic composed of thirteen states, each governed
2mo i, 1:by officials popularly elected under constitutions drafted by "the plain
2mo i, 1:people," was the most significant feature of the eighteenth century. The
2mo i, 1:majority of the patriots whose labors and sacrifices had made this
2mo i, 1:possible naturally looked upon their work and pronounced it good. Those
2mo i, 1:Americans, however, who peered beneath the surface of things, saw that
2mo i, 1:the Declaration of Independence, even if splendidly phrased, and paper
2mo i, 1:constitutions, drawn by finest enthusiasm "uninstructed by experience,"
2mo i, 1:could not alone make the republic great and prosperous or even free. All
2mo i, 1:around them they saw chaos in finance and in industry and perils for the
2mo i, 1:immediate future.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Weakness of the Articles of Confederation.=--The government under
2mo i, 1:the Articles of Confederation had neither the strength nor the resources
2mo i, 1:necessary to cope with the problems of reconstruction left by the war.
2mo i, 1:The sole organ of government was a Congress composed of from two to
2mo i, 1:seven members from each state chosen as the legislature might direct and
2mo i, 1:paid by the state. In determining all questions, each state had one
2mo i, 1:vote--Delaware thus enjoying the same weight as Virginia. There was no
2mo i, 1:president to enforce the laws. Congress was given power to select a
2mo i, 1:committee of thirteen--one from each state--to act as an executive body
2mo i, 1:when it was not in session; but this device, on being tried out, proved
2mo i, 1:a failure. There was no system of national courts to which citizens and
2mo i, 1:states could appeal for the protection of their rights or through which
2mo i, 1:they could compel obedience to law. The two great powers of government,
2mo i, 1:military and financial, were withheld. Congress, it is true, could
2mo i, 1:authorize expenditures but had to rely upon the states for the payment
2mo i, 1:of contributions to meet its bills. It could also order the
2mo i, 1:establishment of an army, but it could only request the states to supply
2mo i, 1:their respective quotas of soldiers. It could not lay taxes nor bring
2mo i, 1:any pressure to bear upon a single citizen in the whole country. It
2mo i, 1:could act only through the medium of the state governments.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Financial and Commercial Disorders.=--In the field of public finance,
2mo i, 1:the disorders were pronounced. The huge debt incurred during the war was
2mo i, 1:still outstanding. Congress was unable to pay either the interest or the
2mo i, 1:principal. Public creditors were in despair, as the market value of
2mo i, 1:their bonds sank to twenty-five or even ten cents on the dollar. The
2mo i, 1:current bills of Congress were unpaid. As some one complained, there was
2mo i, 1:not enough money in the treasury to buy pen and ink with which to record
2mo i, 1:the transactions of the shadow legislature. The currency was in utter
2mo i, 1:chaos. Millions of dollars in notes issued by Congress had become mere
2mo i, 1:trash worth a cent or two on the dollar. There was no other expression
2mo i, 1:of contempt so forceful as the popular saying: "not worth a
2mo i, 1:Continental." To make matters worse, several of the states were pouring
2mo i, 1:new streams of paper money from the press. Almost the only good money in
2mo i, 1:circulation consisted of English, French, and Spanish coins, and the
2mo i, 1:public was even defrauded by them because money changers were busy
2mo i, 1:clipping and filing away the metal. Foreign commerce was unsettled. The
2mo i, 1:entire British system of trade discrimination was turned against the
2mo i, 1:Americans, and Congress, having no power to regulate foreign commerce,
2mo i, 1:was unable to retaliate or to negotiate treaties which it could enforce.
2mo i, 1:Domestic commerce was impeded by the jealousies of the states, which
2mo i, 1:erected tariff barriers against their neighbors. The condition of the
2mo i, 1:currency made the exchange of money and goods extremely difficult, and,
2mo i, 1:as if to increase the confusion, backward states enacted laws hindering
2mo i, 1:the prompt collection of debts within their borders--an evil which
2mo i, 1:nothing but a national system of courts could cure.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Congress in Disrepute.=--With treaties set at naught by the states, the
2mo i, 1:laws unenforced, the treasury empty, and the public credit gone, the
2mo i, 1:Congress of the United States fell into utter disrepute. It called upon
2mo i, 1:the states to pay their quotas of money into the treasury, only to be
2mo i, 1:treated with contempt. Even its own members looked upon it as a solemn
2mo i, 1:futility. Some of the ablest men refused to accept election to it, and
2mo i, 1:many who did take the doubtful honor failed to attend the sessions.
2mo i, 1:Again and again it was impossible to secure a quorum for the transaction
2mo i, 1:of business.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Troubles of the State Governments.=--The state governments, free to
2mo i, 1:pursue their own course with no interference from without, had almost as
2mo i, 1:many difficulties as the Congress. They too were loaded with
2mo i, 1:revolutionary debts calling for heavy taxes upon an already restive
2mo i, 1:population. Oppressed by their financial burdens and discouraged by the
2mo i, 1:fall in prices which followed the return of peace, the farmers of
2mo i, 1:several states joined in a concerted effort and compelled their
2mo i, 1:legislatures to issue large sums of paper money. The currency fell in
2mo i, 1:value, but nevertheless it was forced on unwilling creditors to square
2mo i, 1:old accounts.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In every part of the country legislative action fluctuated violently.
2mo i, 1:Laws were made one year only to be repealed the next and reenacted the
2mo i, 1:third year. Lands were sold by one legislature and the sales were
2mo i, 1:canceled by its successor. Uncertainty and distrust were the natural
2mo i, 1:consequences. Men of substance longed for some power that would forbid
2mo i, 1:states to issue bills of credit, to make paper money legal tender in
2mo i, 1:payment of debts, or to impair the obligation of contracts. Men heavily
2mo i, 1:in debt, on the other hand, urged even more drastic action against
2mo i, 1:creditors.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:So great did the discontent of the farmers in New Hampshire become in
2mo i, 1:1786 that a mob surrounded the legislature, demanding a repeal of the
2mo i, 1:taxes and the issuance of paper money. It was with difficulty that an
2mo i, 1:armed rebellion was avoided. In Massachusetts the malcontents, under the
2mo i, 1:leadership of Daniel Shays, a captain in the Revolutionary army,
2mo i, 1:organized that same year open resistance to the government of the state.
2mo i, 1:Shays and his followers protested against the conduct of creditors in
2mo i, 1:foreclosing mortgages upon the debt-burdened farmers, against the
2mo i, 1:lawyers for increasing the costs of legal proceedings, against the
2mo i, 1:senate of the state the members of which were apportioned among the
2mo i, 1:towns on the basis of the amount of taxes paid, against heavy taxes, and
2mo i, 1:against the refusal of the legislature to issue paper money. They seized
2mo i, 1:the towns of Worcester and Springfield and broke up the courts of
2mo i, 1:justice. All through the western part of the state the revolt spread,
2mo i, 1:sending a shock of alarm to every center and section of the young
2mo i, 1:republic. Only by the most vigorous action was Governor Bowdoin able to
2mo i, 1:quell the uprising; and when that task was accomplished, the state
2mo i, 1:government did not dare to execute any of the prisoners because they had
2mo i, 1:so many sympathizers. Moreover, Bowdoin and several members of the
2mo i, 1:legislature who had been most zealous in their attacks on the insurgents
2mo i, 1:were defeated at the ensuing election. The need of national assistance
2mo i, 1:for state governments in times of domestic violence was everywhere
2mo i, 1:emphasized by men who were opposed to revolutionary acts.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Alarm over Dangers to the Republic.=--Leading American citizens,
2mo i, 1:watching the drift of affairs, were slowly driven to the conclusion that
2mo i, 1:the new ship of state so proudly launched a few years before was
2mo i, 1:careening into anarchy. "The facts of our peace and independence," wrote
2mo i, 1:a friend of Washington, "do not at present wear so promising an
2mo i, 1:appearance as I had fondly painted in my mind. The prejudices,
2mo i, 1:jealousies, and turbulence of the people at times almost stagger my
2mo i, 1:confidence in our political establishments; and almost occasion me to
2mo i, 1:think that they will show themselves unworthy of the noble prize for
2mo i, 1:which we have contended."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Washington himself was profoundly discouraged. On hearing of Shays's
2mo i, 1:rebellion, he exclaimed: "What, gracious God, is man that there should
2mo i, 1:be such inconsistency and perfidiousness in his conduct! It is but the
2mo i, 1:other day that we were shedding our blood to obtain the constitutions
2mo i, 1:under which we now live--constitutions of our own choice and making--and
2mo i, 1:now we are unsheathing our sword to overturn them." The same year he
2mo i, 1:burst out in a lament over rumors of restoring royal government. "I am
2mo i, 1:told that even respectable characters speak of a monarchical government
2mo i, 1:without horror. From thinking proceeds speaking. Hence to acting is
2mo i, 1:often but a single step. But how irresistible and tremendous! What a
2mo i, 1:triumph for our enemies to verify their predictions! What a triumph for
2mo i, 1:the advocates of despotism to find that we are incapable of governing
2mo i, 1:ourselves!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Congress Attempts Some Reforms.=--The Congress was not indifferent to
2mo i, 1:the events that disturbed Washington. On the contrary it put forth many
2mo i, 1:efforts to check tendencies so dangerous to finance, commerce,
2mo i, 1:industries, and the Confederation itself. In 1781, even before the
2mo i, 1:treaty of peace was signed, the Congress, having found out how futile
2mo i, 1:were its taxing powers, carried a resolution of amendment to the
2mo i, 1:Articles of Confederation, authorizing the levy of a moderate duty on
2mo i, 1:imports. Yet this mild measure was rejected by the states. Two years
2mo i, 1:later the Congress prepared another amendment sanctioning the levy of
2mo i, 1:duties on imports, to be collected this time by state officers and
2mo i, 1:applied to the payment of the public debt. This more limited proposal,
2mo i, 1:designed to save public credit, likewise failed. In 1786, the Congress
2mo i, 1:made a third appeal to the states for help, declaring that they had been
2mo i, 1:so irregular and so negligent in paying their quotas that further
2mo i, 1:reliance upon that mode of raising revenues was dishonorable and
2mo i, 1:dangerous.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE CALLING OF A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Hamilton and Washington Urge Reform.=--The attempts at reform by the
2mo i, 1:Congress were accompanied by demand for, both within and without that
2mo i, 1:body, a convention to frame a new plan of government. In 1780, the
2mo i, 1:youthful Alexander Hamilton, realizing the weakness of the Articles, so
2mo i, 1:widely discussed, proposed a general convention for the purpose of
2mo i, 1:drafting a new constitution on entirely different principles. With
2mo i, 1:tireless energy he strove to bring his countrymen to his view.
2mo i, 1:Washington, agreeing with him on every point, declared, in a circular
2mo i, 1:letter to the governors, that the duration of the union would be short
2mo i, 1:unless there was lodged somewhere a supreme power "to regulate and
2mo i, 1:govern the general concerns of the confederated republic." The governor
2mo i, 1:of Massachusetts, disturbed by the growth of discontent all about him,
2mo i, 1:suggested to the state legislature in 1785 the advisability of a
2mo i, 1:national convention to enlarge the powers of the Congress. The
2mo i, 1:legislature approved the plan, but did not press it to a conclusion.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: ALEXANDER HAMILTON]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Annapolis Convention.=--Action finally came from the South. The
2mo i, 1:Virginia legislature, taking things into its own hands, called a
2mo i, 1:conference of delegates at Annapolis to consider matters of taxation and
2mo i, 1:commerce. When the convention assembled in 1786, it was found that only
2mo i, 1:five states had taken the trouble to send representatives. The leaders
2mo i, 1:were deeply discouraged, but the resourceful Hamilton, a delegate from
2mo i, 1:New York, turned the affair to good account. He secured the adoption of
2mo i, 1:a resolution, calling upon the Congress itself to summon another
2mo i, 1:convention, to meet at Philadelphia.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=A National Convention Called (1787).=--The Congress, as tardy as ever,
2mo i, 1:at last decided in February, 1787, to issue the call. Fearing drastic
2mo i, 1:changes, however, it restricted the convention to "the sole and express
2mo i, 1:purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation." Jealous of its own
2mo i, 1:powers, it added that any alterations proposed should be referred to the
2mo i, 1:Congress and the states for their approval.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Every state in the union, except Rhode Island, responded to this call.
2mo i, 1:Indeed some of the states, having the Annapolis resolution before them,
2mo i, 1:had already anticipated the Congress by selecting delegates before the
2mo i, 1:formal summons came. Thus, by the persistence of governors,
2mo i, 1:legislatures, and private citizens, there was brought about the
2mo i, 1:long-desired national convention. In May, 1787, it assembled in
2mo i, 1:Philadelphia.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Eminent Men of the Convention.=--On the roll of that memorable
2mo i, 1:convention were fifty-five men, at least half of whom were acknowledged
2mo i, 1:to be among the foremost statesmen and thinkers in America. Every field
2mo i, 1:of statecraft was represented by them: war and practical management in
2mo i, 1:Washington, who was chosen president of the convention; diplomacy in
2mo i, 1:Franklin, now old and full of honor in his own land as well as abroad;
2mo i, 1:finance in Alexander Hamilton and Robert Morris; law in James Wilson of
2mo i, 1:Pennsylvania; the philosophy of government in James Madison, called the
2mo i, 1:"father of the Constitution." They were not theorists but practical men,
2mo i, 1:rich in political experience and endowed with deep insight into the
2mo i, 1:springs of human action. Three of them had served in the Stamp Act
2mo i, 1:Congress: Dickinson of Delaware, William Samuel Johnson of Connecticut,
2mo i, 1:and John Rutledge of South Carolina. Eight had been signers of the
2mo i, 1:Declaration of Independence: Read of Delaware, Sherman of Connecticut,
2mo i, 1:Wythe of Virginia, Gerry of Massachusetts, Franklin, Robert Morris,
2mo i, 1:George Clymer, and James Wilson of Pennsylvania. All but twelve had at
2mo i, 1:some time served in the Continental Congress and eighteen were members
2mo i, 1:of that body in the spring of 1787. Washington, Hamilton, Mifflin, and
2mo i, 1:Charles Pinckney had been officers in the Revolutionary army. Seven of
2mo i, 1:the delegates had gained political experience as governors of states.
2mo i, 1:"The convention as a whole," according to the historian Hildreth,
2mo i, 1:"represented in a marked manner the talent, intelligence, and
2mo i, 1:especially the conservative sentiment of the country."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE FRAMING OF THE CONSTITUTION
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Problems Involved.=--The great problems before the convention were nine
2mo i, 1:in number: (1) Shall the Articles of Confederation be revised or a new
2mo i, 1:system of government constructed? (2) Shall the government be founded on
2mo i, 1:states equal in power as under the Articles or on the broader and deeper
2mo i, 1:foundation of population? (3) What direct share shall the people have in
2mo i, 1:the election of national officers? (4) What shall be the qualifications
2mo i, 1:for the suffrage? (5) How shall the conflicting interests of the
2mo i, 1:commercial and the planting states be balanced so as to safeguard the
2mo i, 1:essential rights of each? (6) What shall be the form of the new
2mo i, 1:government? (7) What powers shall be conferred on it? (8) How shall the
2mo i, 1:state legislatures be restrained from their attacks on property rights
2mo i, 1:such as the issuance of paper money? (9) Shall the approval of all the
2mo i, 1:states be necessary, as under the Articles, for the adoption and
2mo i, 1:amendment of the Constitution?
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Revision of the Articles or a New Government?=--The moment the first
2mo i, 1:problem was raised, representatives of the small states, led by William
2mo i, 1:Paterson of New Jersey, were on their feet. They feared that, if the
2mo i, 1:Articles were overthrown, the equality and rights of the states would be
2mo i, 1:put in jeopardy. Their protest was therefore vigorous. They cited the
2mo i, 1:call issued by the Congress in summoning the convention which
2mo i, 1:specifically stated that they were assembled for "the sole and express
2mo i, 1:purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation." They cited also
2mo i, 1:their instructions from their state legislatures, which authorized them
2mo i, 1:to "revise and amend" the existing scheme of government, not to make a
2mo i, 1:revolution in it. To depart from the authorization laid down by the
2mo i, 1:Congress and the legislatures would be to exceed their powers, they
2mo i, 1:argued, and to betray the trust reposed in them by their countrymen.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:To their contentions, Randolph of Virginia replied: "When the salvation
2mo i, 1:of the republic is at stake, it would be treason to our trust not to
2mo i, 1:propose what we find necessary." Hamilton, reminding the delegates that
2mo i, 1:their work was still subject to the approval of the states, frankly said
2mo i, 1:that on the point of their powers he had no scruples. With the issue
2mo i, 1:clear, the convention cast aside the Articles as if they did not exist
2mo i, 1:and proceeded to the work of drawing up a new constitution, "laying its
2mo i, 1:foundations on such principles and organizing its powers in such form"
2mo i, 1:as to the delegates seemed "most likely to affect their safety and
2mo i, 1:happiness."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=A Government Founded on States or on People?--The
2mo i, 1:Compromise.=--Defeated in their attempt to limit the convention to a
2mo i, 1:mere revision of the Articles, the spokesmen of the smaller states
2mo i, 1:redoubled their efforts to preserve the equality of the states. The
2mo i, 1:signal for a radical departure from the Articles on this point was given
2mo i, 1:early in the sessions when Randolph presented "the Virginia plan." He
2mo i, 1:proposed that the new national legislature consist of two houses, the
2mo i, 1:members of which were to be apportioned among the states according to
2mo i, 1:their wealth or free white population, as the convention might decide.
2mo i, 1:This plan was vehemently challenged. Paterson of New Jersey flatly
2mo i, 1:avowed that neither he nor his state would ever bow to such tyranny. As
2mo i, 1:an alternative, he presented "the New Jersey plan" calling for a
2mo i, 1:national legislature of one house representing states as such, not
2mo i, 1:wealth or people--a legislature in which all states, large or small,
2mo i, 1:would have equal voice. Wilson of Pennsylvania, on behalf of the more
2mo i, 1:populous states, took up the gauntlet which Paterson had thrown down. It
2mo i, 1:was absurd, he urged, for 180,000 men in one state to have the same
2mo i, 1:weight in national counsels as 750,000 men in another state. "The
2mo i, 1:gentleman from New Jersey," he said, "is candid. He declares his opinion
2mo i, 1:boldly.... I will be equally candid.... I will never confederate on his
2mo i, 1:principles." So the bitter controversy ran on through many exciting
2mo i, 1:sessions.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Greek had met Greek. The convention was hopelessly deadlocked and on the
2mo i, 1:verge of dissolution, "scarce held together by the strength of a hair,"
2mo i, 1:as one of the delegates remarked. A crash was averted only by a
2mo i, 1:compromise. Instead of a Congress of one house as provided by the
2mo i, 1:Articles, the convention agreed upon a legislature of two houses. In the
2mo i, 1:Senate, the aspirations of the small states were to be satisfied, for
2mo i, 1:each state was given two members in that body. In the formation of the
2mo i, 1:House of Representatives, the larger states were placated, for it was
2mo i, 1:agreed that the members of that chamber were to be apportioned among the
2mo i, 1:states on the basis of population, counting three-fifths of the slaves.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Question of Popular Election.=--The method of selecting federal
2mo i, 1:officers and members of Congress also produced an acrimonious debate
2mo i, 1:which revealed how deep-seated was the distrust of the capacity of the
2mo i, 1:people to govern themselves. Few there were who believed that no branch
2mo i, 1:of the government should be elected directly by the voters; still fewer
2mo i, 1:were there, however, who desired to see all branches so chosen. One or
2mo i, 1:two even expressed a desire for a monarchy. The dangers of democracy
2mo i, 1:were stressed by Gerry of Massachusetts: "All the evils we experience
2mo i, 1:flow from an excess of democracy. The people do not want virtue but are
2mo i, 1:the dupes of pretended patriots.... I have been too republican
2mo i, 1:heretofore but have been taught by experience the danger of a leveling
2mo i, 1:spirit." To the "democratic licentiousness of the state legislatures,"
2mo i, 1:Randolph sought to oppose a "firm senate." To check the excesses of
2mo i, 1:popular government Charles Pinckney of South Carolina declared that no
2mo i, 1:one should be elected President who was not worth $100,000 and that high
2mo i, 1:property qualifications should be placed on members of Congress and
2mo i, 1:judges. Other members of the convention were stoutly opposed to such
2mo i, 1:"high-toned notions of government." Franklin and Wilson, both from
2mo i, 1:Pennsylvania, vigorously championed popular election; while men like
2mo i, 1:Madison insisted that at least one part of the government should rest on
2mo i, 1:the broad foundation of the people.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Out of this clash of opinion also came compromise. One branch, the House
2mo i, 1:of Representatives, it was agreed, was to be elected directly by the
2mo i, 1:voters, while the Senators were to be elected indirectly by the state
2mo i, 1:legislatures. The President was to be chosen by electors selected as the
2mo i, 1:legislatures of the states might determine, and the judges of the
2mo i, 1:federal courts, supreme and inferior, by the President and the Senate.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Question of the Suffrage.=--The battle over the suffrage was sharp
2mo i, 1:but brief. Gouverneur Morris proposed that only land owners should be
2mo i, 1:permitted to vote. Madison replied that the state legislatures, which
2mo i, 1:had made so much trouble with radical laws, were elected by freeholders.
2mo i, 1:After the debate, the delegates, unable to agree on any property
2mo i, 1:limitations on the suffrage, decided that the House of Representatives
2mo i, 1:should be elected by voters having the "qualifications requisite for
2mo i, 1:electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature." Thus
2mo i, 1:they accepted the suffrage provisions of the states.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Balance between the Planting and the Commercial States.=--After the
2mo i, 1:debates had gone on for a few weeks, Madison came to the conclusion that
2mo i, 1:the real division in the convention was not between the large and the
2mo i, 1:small states but between the planting section founded on slave labor and
2mo i, 1:the commercial North. Thus he anticipated by nearly three-quarters of a
2mo i, 1:century "the irrepressible conflict." The planting states had neither
2mo i, 1:the free white population nor the wealth of the North. There were,
2mo i, 1:counting Delaware, six of them as against seven commercial states.
2mo i, 1:Dependent for their prosperity mainly upon the sale of tobacco, rice,
2mo i, 1:and other staples abroad, they feared that Congress might impose
2mo i, 1:restraints upon their enterprise. Being weaker in numbers, they were
2mo i, 1:afraid that the majority might lay an unfair burden of taxes upon them.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_Representation and Taxation._--The Southern members of the convention
2mo i, 1:were therefore very anxious to secure for their section the largest
2mo i, 1:possible representation in Congress, and at the same time to restrain
2mo i, 1:the taxing power of that body. Two devices were thought adapted to these
2mo i, 1:ends. One was to count the slaves as people when apportioning
2mo i, 1:representatives among the states according to their respective
2mo i, 1:populations; the other was to provide that direct taxes should be
2mo i, 1:apportioned among the states, in proportion not to their wealth but to
2mo i, 1:the number of their free white inhabitants. For obvious reasons the
2mo i, 1:Northern delegates objected to these proposals. Once more a compromise
2mo i, 1:proved to be the solution. It was agreed that not all the slaves but
2mo i, 1:three-fifths of them should be counted for both purposes--representation
2mo i, 1:and direct taxation.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_Commerce and the Slave Trade._--Southern interests were also involved
2mo i, 1:in the project to confer upon Congress the power to regulate interstate
2mo i, 1:and foreign commerce. To the manufacturing and trading states this was
2mo i, 1:essential. It would prevent interstate tariffs and trade jealousies; it
2mo i, 1:would enable Congress to protect American manufactures and to break
2mo i, 1:down, by appropriate retaliations, foreign discriminations against
2mo i, 1:American commerce. To the South the proposal was menacing because
2mo i, 1:tariffs might interfere with the free exchange of the produce of
2mo i, 1:plantations in European markets, and navigation acts might confine the
2mo i, 1:carrying trade to American, that is Northern, ships. The importation of
2mo i, 1:slaves, moreover, it was feared might be heavily taxed or immediately
2mo i, 1:prohibited altogether.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The result of this and related controversies was a debate on the merits
2mo i, 1:of slavery. Gouverneur Morris delivered his mind and heart on that
2mo i, 1:subject, denouncing slavery as a nefarious institution and the curse of
2mo i, 1:heaven on the states in which it prevailed. Mason of Virginia, a
2mo i, 1:slaveholder himself, was hardly less outspoken, saying: "Slavery
2mo i, 1:discourages arts and manufactures. The poor despise labor when performed
2mo i, 1:by slaves. They prevent the migration of whites who really strengthen
2mo i, 1:and enrich a country."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The system, however, had its defenders. Representatives from South
2mo i, 1:Carolina argued that their entire economic life rested on slave labor
2mo i, 1:and that the high death rate in the rice swamps made continuous
2mo i, 1:importation necessary. Ellsworth of Connecticut took the ground that
2mo i, 1:the convention should not meddle with slavery. "The morality or wisdom
2mo i, 1:of slavery," he said, "are considerations belonging to the states. What
2mo i, 1:enriches a part enriches the whole." To the future he turned an
2mo i, 1:untroubled face: "As population increases, poor laborers will be so
2mo i, 1:plenty as to render slaves useless. Slavery in time will not be a speck
2mo i, 1:in our country." Virginia and North Carolina, already overstocked with
2mo i, 1:slaves, favored prohibiting the traffic in them; but South Carolina was
2mo i, 1:adamant. She must have fresh supplies of slaves or she would not
2mo i, 1:federate.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:So it was agreed that, while Congress might regulate foreign trade by
2mo i, 1:majority vote, the importation of slaves should not be forbidden before
2mo i, 1:the lapse of twenty years, and that any import tax should not exceed $10
2mo i, 1:a head. At the same time, in connection with the regulation of foreign
2mo i, 1:trade, it was stipulated that a two-thirds vote in the Senate should be
2mo i, 1:necessary in the ratification of treaties. A further concession to the
2mo i, 1:South was made in the provision for the return of runaway slaves--a
2mo i, 1:provision also useful in the North, where indentured servants were about
2mo i, 1:as troublesome as slaves in escaping from their masters.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Form of the Government.=--As to the details of the frame of
2mo i, 1:government and the grand principles involved, the opinion of the
2mo i, 1:convention ebbed and flowed, decisions being taken in the heat of
2mo i, 1:debate, only to be revoked and taken again.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_The Executive._--There was general agreement that there should be an
2mo i, 1:executive branch; for reliance upon Congress to enforce its own laws and
2mo i, 1:treaties had been a broken reed. On the character and functions of the
2mo i, 1:executive, however, there were many views. The New Jersey plan called
2mo i, 1:for a council selected by the Congress; the Virginia plan provided that
2mo i, 1:the executive branch should be chosen by the Congress but did not state
2mo i, 1:whether it should be composed of one or several persons. On this matter
2mo i, 1:the convention voted first one way and then another; finally it agreed
2mo i, 1:on a single executive chosen indirectly by electors selected as the
2mo i, 1:state legislatures might decide, serving for four years, subject to
2mo i, 1:impeachment, and endowed with regal powers in the command of the army
2mo i, 1:and the navy and in the enforcement of the laws.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_The Legislative Branch--Congress._--After the convention had made the
2mo i, 1:great compromise between the large and small commonwealths by giving
2mo i, 1:representation to states in the Senate and to population in the House,
2mo i, 1:the question of methods of election had to be decided. As to the House
2mo i, 1:of Representatives it was readily agreed that the members should be
2mo i, 1:elected by direct popular vote. There was also easy agreement on the
2mo i, 1:proposition that a strong Senate was needed to check the "turbulence" of
2mo i, 1:the lower house. Four devices were finally selected to accomplish this
2mo i, 1:purpose. In the first place, the Senators were not to be chosen directly
2mo i, 1:by the voters but by the legislatures of the states, thus removing their
2mo i, 1:election one degree from the populace. In the second place, their term
2mo i, 1:was fixed at six years instead of two, as in the case of the House. In
2mo i, 1:the third place, provision was made for continuity by having only
2mo i, 1:one-third of the members go out at a time while two-thirds remained in
2mo i, 1:service. Finally, it was provided that Senators must be at least thirty
2mo i, 1:years old while Representatives need be only twenty-five.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_The Judiciary._--The need for federal courts to carry out the law was
2mo i, 1:hardly open to debate. The feebleness of the Articles of Confederation
2mo i, 1:was, in a large measure, attributed to the want of a judiciary to hold
2mo i, 1:states and individuals in obedience to the laws and treaties of the
2mo i, 1:union. Nevertheless on this point the advocates of states' rights were
2mo i, 1:extremely sensitive. They looked with distrust upon judges appointed at
2mo i, 1:the national capital and emancipated from local interests and
2mo i, 1:traditions; they remembered with what insistence they had claimed
2mo i, 1:against Britain the right of local trial by jury and with what
2mo i, 1:consternation they had viewed the proposal to make colonial judges
2mo i, 1:independent of the assemblies in the matter of their salaries.
2mo i, 1:Reluctantly they yielded to the demand for federal courts, consenting at
2mo i, 1:first only to a supreme court to review cases heard in lower state
2mo i, 1:courts and finally to such additional inferior courts as Congress might
2mo i, 1:deem necessary.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_The System of Checks and Balances._--It is thus apparent that the
2mo i, 1:framers of the Constitution, in shaping the form of government, arranged
2mo i, 1:for a distribution of power among three branches, executive,
2mo i, 1:legislative, and judicial. Strictly speaking we might say four branches,
2mo i, 1:for the legislature, or Congress, was composed of two houses, elected in
2mo i, 1:different ways, and one of them, the Senate, was made a check on the
2mo i, 1:President through its power of ratifying treaties and appointments. "The
2mo i, 1:accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judicial, in the
2mo i, 1:same hands," wrote Madison, "whether of one, a few, or many, and whether
2mo i, 1:hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the
2mo i, 1:very definition of tyranny." The devices which the convention adopted to
2mo i, 1:prevent such a centralization of authority were exceedingly ingenious
2mo i, 1:and well calculated to accomplish the purposes of the authors.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The legislature consisted of two houses, the members of which were to be
2mo i, 1:apportioned on a different basis, elected in different ways, and to
2mo i, 1:serve for different terms. A veto on all its acts was vested in a
2mo i, 1:President elected in a manner not employed in the choice of either
2mo i, 1:branch of the legislature, serving for four years, and subject to
2mo i, 1:removal only by the difficult process of impeachment. After a law had
2mo i, 1:run the gantlet of both houses and the executive, it was subject to
2mo i, 1:interpretation and annulment by the judiciary, appointed by the
2mo i, 1:President with the consent of the Senate and serving for life. Thus it
2mo i, 1:was made almost impossible for any political party to get possession of
2mo i, 1:all branches of the government at a single popular election. As Hamilton
2mo i, 1:remarked, the friends of good government considered "every institution
2mo i, 1:calculated to restrain the excess of law making and to keep things in
2mo i, 1:the same state in which they happen to be at any given period as more
2mo i, 1:likely to do good than harm."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Powers of the Federal Government.=--On the question of the powers
2mo i, 1:to be conferred upon the new government there was less occasion for a
2mo i, 1:serious dispute. Even the delegates from the small states agreed with
2mo i, 1:those from Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia that new powers
2mo i, 1:should be added to those intrusted to Congress by the Articles of
2mo i, 1:Confederation. The New Jersey plan as well as the Virginia plan
2mo i, 1:recognized this fact. Some of the delegates, like Hamilton and Madison,
2mo i, 1:even proposed to give Congress a general legislative authority covering
2mo i, 1:all national matters; but others, frightened by the specter of
2mo i, 1:nationalism, insisted on specifying each power to be conferred and
2mo i, 1:finally carried the day.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_Taxation and Commerce._--There were none bold enough to dissent from
2mo i, 1:the proposition that revenue must be provided to pay current expenses
2mo i, 1:and discharge the public debt. When once the dispute over the
2mo i, 1:apportionment of direct taxes among the slave states was settled, it was
2mo i, 1:an easy matter to decide that Congress should have power to lay and
2mo i, 1:collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises. In this way the national
2mo i, 1:government was freed from dependence upon stubborn and tardy
2mo i, 1:legislatures and enabled to collect funds directly from citizens. There
2mo i, 1:were likewise none bold enough to contend that the anarchy of state
2mo i, 1:tariffs and trade discriminations should be longer endured. When the
2mo i, 1:fears of the planting states were allayed and the "bargain" over the
2mo i, 1:importation of slaves was reached, the convention vested in Congress the
2mo i, 1:power to regulate foreign and interstate commerce.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_National Defense._--The necessity for national defense was realized,
2mo i, 1:though the fear of huge military establishments was equally present. The
2mo i, 1:old practice of relying on quotas furnished by the state legislatures
2mo i, 1:was completely discredited. As in the case of taxes a direct authority
2mo i, 1:over citizens was demanded. Congress was therefore given full power to
2mo i, 1:raise and support armies and a navy. It could employ the state militia
2mo i, 1:when desirable; but it could at the same time maintain a regular army
2mo i, 1:and call directly upon all able-bodied males if the nature of a crisis
2mo i, 1:was thought to require it.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_The "Necessary and Proper" Clause._--To the specified power vested in
2mo i, 1:Congress by the Constitution, the advocates of a strong national
2mo i, 1:government added a general clause authorizing it to make all laws
2mo i, 1:"necessary and proper" for carrying into effect any and all of the
2mo i, 1:enumerated powers. This clause, interpreted by that master mind, Chief
2mo i, 1:Justice Marshall, was later construed to confer powers as wide as the
2mo i, 1:requirements of a vast country spanning a continent and taking its place
2mo i, 1:among the mighty nations of the earth.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Restraints on the States.=--Framing a government and endowing it with
2mo i, 1:large powers were by no means the sole concern of the convention. Its
2mo i, 1:very existence had been due quite as much to the conduct of the state
2mo i, 1:legislatures as to the futilities of a paralyzed Continental Congress.
2mo i, 1:In every state, explains Marshall in his _Life of Washington_, there was
2mo i, 1:a party of men who had "marked out for themselves a more indulgent
2mo i, 1:course. Viewing with extreme tenderness the case of the debtor, their
2mo i, 1:efforts were unceasingly directed to his relief. To exact a faithful
2mo i, 1:compliance with contracts was, in their opinion, a harsh measure which
2mo i, 1:the people could not bear. They were uniformly in favor of relaxing the
2mo i, 1:administration of justice, of affording facilities for the payment of
2mo i, 1:debts, or of suspending their collection, and remitting taxes."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The legislatures under the dominance of these men had enacted paper
2mo i, 1:money laws enabling debtors to discharge their obligations more easily.
2mo i, 1:The convention put an end to such practices by providing that no state
2mo i, 1:should emit bills of credit or make anything but gold or silver legal
2mo i, 1:tender in the payment of debts. The state legislatures had enacted laws
2mo i, 1:allowing men to pay their debts by turning over to creditors land or
2mo i, 1:personal property; they had repealed the charter of an endowed college
2mo i, 1:and taken the management from the hands of the lawful trustees; and they
2mo i, 1:had otherwise interfered with the enforcement of private agreements. The
2mo i, 1:convention, taking notice of such matters, inserted a clause forbidding
2mo i, 1:states "to impair the obligation of contracts." The more venturous of
2mo i, 1:the radicals had in Massachusetts raised the standard of revolt against
2mo i, 1:the authorities of the state. The convention answered by a brief
2mo i, 1:sentence to the effect that the President of the United States, to be
2mo i, 1:equipped with a regular army, would send troops to suppress domestic
2mo i, 1:insurrections whenever called upon by the legislature or, if it was not
2mo i, 1:in session, by the governor of the state. To make sure that the
2mo i, 1:restrictions on the states would not be dead letters, the federal
2mo i, 1:Constitution, laws, and treaties were made the supreme law of the land,
2mo i, 1:to be enforced whenever necessary by a national judiciary and executive
2mo i, 1:against violations on the part of any state authorities.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Provisions for Ratification and Amendment.=--When the frame of
2mo i, 1:government had been determined, the powers to be vested in it had been
2mo i, 1:enumerated, and the restrictions upon the states had been written into
2mo i, 1:the bond, there remained three final questions. How shall the
2mo i, 1:Constitution be ratified? What number of states shall be necessary to
2mo i, 1:put it into effect? How shall it be amended in the future?
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:On the first point, the mandate under which the convention was sitting
2mo i, 1:seemed positive. The Articles of Confederation were still in effect.
2mo i, 1:They provided that amendments could be made only by unanimous adoption
2mo i, 1:in Congress and the approval of all the states. As if to give force to
2mo i, 1:this provision of law, the call for the convention had expressly stated
2mo i, 1:that all alterations and revisions should be reported to Congress for
2mo i, 1:adoption or rejection, Congress itself to transmit the document
2mo i, 1:thereafter to the states for their review.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:To have observed the strict letter of the law would have defeated the
2mo i, 1:purposes of the delegates, because Congress and the state legislatures
2mo i, 1:were openly hostile to such drastic changes as had been made. Unanimous
2mo i, 1:ratification, as events proved, would have been impossible. Therefore
2mo i, 1:the delegates decided that the Constitution should be sent to Congress
2mo i, 1:with the recommendation that it, in turn, transmit the document, not to
2mo i, 1:the state legislatures, but to conventions held in the states for the
2mo i, 1:special object of deciding upon ratification. This process was followed.
2mo i, 1:It was their belief that special conventions would be more friendly than
2mo i, 1:the state legislatures.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The convention was equally positive in dealing with the problem of the
2mo i, 1:number of states necessary to establish the new Constitution. Attempts
2mo i, 1:to change the Articles had failed because amendment required the
2mo i, 1:approval of every state and there was always at least one recalcitrant
2mo i, 1:member of the union. The opposition to a new Constitution was
2mo i, 1:undoubtedly formidable. Rhode Island had even refused to take part in
2mo i, 1:framing it, and her hostility was deep and open. So the convention cast
2mo i, 1:aside the provision of the Articles of Confederation which required
2mo i, 1:unanimous approval for any change in the plan of government; it decreed
2mo i, 1:that the new Constitution should go into effect when ratified by nine
2mo i, 1:states.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In providing for future changes in the Constitution itself the
2mo i, 1:convention also thrust aside the old rule of unanimous approval, and
2mo i, 1:decided that an amendment could be made on a two-thirds vote in both
2mo i, 1:houses of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states. This
2mo i, 1:change was of profound significance. Every state agreed to be bound in
2mo i, 1:the future by amendments duly adopted even in case it did not approve
2mo i, 1:them itself. America in this way set out upon the high road that led
2mo i, 1:from a league of states to a nation.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE STRUGGLE OVER RATIFICATION
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:On September 17, 1787, the Constitution, having been finally drafted in
2mo i, 1:clear and simple language, a model to all makers of fundamental law, was
2mo i, 1:adopted. The convention, after nearly four months of debate in secret
2mo i, 1:session, flung open the doors and presented to the Americans the
2mo i, 1:finished plan for the new government. Then the great debate passed to
2mo i, 1:the people.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Opposition.=--Storms of criticism at once descended upon the
2mo i, 1:Constitution. "Fraudulent usurpation!" exclaimed Gerry, who had refused
2mo i, 1:to sign it. "A monster" out of the "thick veil of secrecy," declaimed a
2mo i, 1:Pennsylvania newspaper. "An iron-handed despotism will be the result,"
2mo i, 1:protested a third. "We, 'the low-born,'" sarcastically wrote a fourth,
2mo i, 1:"will now admit the 'six hundred well-born' immediately to establish
2mo i, 1:this most noble, most excellent, and truly divine constitution." The
2mo i, 1:President will become a king; Congress will be as tyrannical as
2mo i, 1:Parliament in the old days; the states will be swallowed up; the rights
2mo i, 1:of the people will be trampled upon; the poor man's justice will be lost
2mo i, 1:in the endless delays of the federal courts--such was the strain of the
2mo i, 1:protests against ratification.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: AN ADVERTISEMENT OF _The Federalist_]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Defense of the Constitution.=--Moved by the tempest of opposition,
2mo i, 1:Hamilton, Madison, and Jay took up their pens in defense of the
2mo i, 1:Constitution. In a series of newspaper articles they discussed and
2mo i, 1:expounded with eloquence, learning, and dignity every important clause
2mo i, 1:and provision of the proposed plan. These papers, afterwards collected
2mo i, 1:and published in a volume known as _The Federalist_, form the finest
2mo i, 1:textbook on the Constitution that has ever been printed. It takes its
2mo i, 1:place, moreover, among the wisest and weightiest treatises on government
2mo i, 1:ever written in any language in any time. Other men, not so gifted, were
2mo i, 1:no less earnest in their support of ratification. In private
2mo i, 1:correspondence, editorials, pamphlets, and letters to the newspapers,
2mo i, 1:they urged their countrymen to forget their partisanship and accept a
2mo i, 1:Constitution which, in spite of any defects great or small, was the
2mo i, 1:only guarantee against dissolution and warfare at home and dishonor and
2mo i, 1:weakness abroad.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: CELEBRATING THE RATIFICATION]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Action of the State Conventions.=--Before the end of the year,
2mo i, 1:1787, three states had ratified the Constitution: Delaware and New
2mo i, 1:Jersey unanimously and Pennsylvania after a short, though savage,
2mo i, 1:contest. Connecticut and Georgia followed early the next year. Then came
2mo i, 1:the battle royal in Massachusetts, ending in ratification in February by
2mo i, 1:the narrow margin of 187 votes to 168. In the spring came the news that
2mo i, 1:Maryland and South Carolina were "under the new roof." On June 21, New
2mo i, 1:Hampshire, where the sentiment was at first strong enough to defeat the
2mo i, 1:Constitution, joined the new republic, influenced by the favorable
2mo i, 1:decision in Massachusetts. Swift couriers were sent to carry the news to
2mo i, 1:New York and Virginia, where the question of ratification was still
2mo i, 1:undecided. Nine states had accepted it and were united, whether more saw
2mo i, 1:fit to join or not.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Meanwhile, however, Virginia, after a long and searching debate, had
2mo i, 1:given her approval by a narrow margin, leaving New York as the next seat
2mo i, 1:of anxiety. In that state the popular vote for the delegates to the
2mo i, 1:convention had been clearly and heavily against ratification. Events
2mo i, 1:finally demonstrated the futility of resistance, and Hamilton by good
2mo i, 1:judgment and masterly arguments was at last able to marshal a majority
2mo i, 1:of thirty to twenty-seven votes in favor of ratification.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The great contest was over. All the states, except North Carolina and
2mo i, 1:Rhode Island, had ratified. "The sloop Anarchy," wrote an ebullient
2mo i, 1:journalist, "when last heard from was ashore on Union rocks."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The First Election.=--In the autumn of 1788, elections were held to
2mo i, 1:fill the places in the new government. Public opinion was overwhelmingly
2mo i, 1:in favor of Washington as the first President. Yielding to the
2mo i, 1:importunities of friends, he accepted the post in the spirit of public
2mo i, 1:service. On April 30, 1789, he took the oath of office at Federal Hall
2mo i, 1:in New York City. "Long live George Washington, President of the United
2mo i, 1:States!" cried Chancellor Livingston as soon as the General had kissed
2mo i, 1:the Bible. The cry was caught by the assembled multitude and given back.
2mo i, 1:A new experiment in popular government was launched.

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE CLASH OF POLITICAL PARTIES
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE MEN AND MEASURES OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Friends of the Constitution in Power.=--In the first Congress that
2mo i, 1:assembled after the adoption of the Constitution, there were eleven
2mo i, 1:Senators, led by Robert Morris, the financier, who had been delegates to
2mo i, 1:the national convention. Several members of the House of
2mo i, 1:Representatives, headed by James Madison, had also been at Philadelphia
2mo i, 1:in 1787. In making his appointments, Washington strengthened the new
2mo i, 1:system of government still further by a judicious selection of
2mo i, 1:officials. He chose as Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton,
2mo i, 1:who had been the most zealous for its success; General Knox, head of the
2mo i, 1:War Department, and Edmund Randolph, the Attorney-General, were likewise
2mo i, 1:conspicuous friends of the experiment. Every member of the federal
2mo i, 1:judiciary whom Washington appointed, from the Chief Justice, John Jay,
2mo i, 1:down to the justices of the district courts, had favored the
2mo i, 1:ratification of the Constitution; and a majority of them had served as
2mo i, 1:members of the national convention that framed the document or of the
2mo i, 1:state ratifying conventions. Only one man of influence in the new
2mo i, 1:government, Thomas Jefferson, the Secretary of State, was reckoned as a
2mo i, 1:doubter in the house of the faithful. He had expressed opinions both for
2mo i, 1:and against the Constitution; but he had been out of the country acting
2mo i, 1:as the minister at Paris when the Constitution was drafted and ratified.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=An Opposition to Conciliate.=--The inauguration of Washington amid the
2mo i, 1:plaudits of his countrymen did not set at rest all the political turmoil
2mo i, 1:which had been aroused by the angry contest over ratification. "The
2mo i, 1:interesting nature of the question," wrote John Marshall, "the equality
2mo i, 1:of the parties, the animation produced inevitably by ardent debate had a
2mo i, 1:necessary tendency to embitter the dispositions of the vanquished and to
2mo i, 1:fix more deeply in many bosoms their prejudices against a plan of
2mo i, 1:government in opposition to which all their passions were enlisted." The
2mo i, 1:leaders gathered around Washington were well aware of the excited state
2mo i, 1:of the country. They saw Rhode Island and North Carolina still outside
2mo i, 1:of the union.[1] They knew by what small margins the Constitution had
2mo i, 1:been approved in the great states of Massachusetts, Virginia, and New
2mo i, 1:York. They were equally aware that a majority of the state conventions,
2mo i, 1:in yielding reluctant approval to the Constitution, had drawn a number
2mo i, 1:of amendments for immediate submission to the states.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The First Amendments--a Bill of Rights.=--To meet the opposition,
2mo i, 1:Madison proposed, and the first Congress adopted, a series of amendments
2mo i, 1:to the Constitution. Ten of them were soon ratified and became in 1791 a
2mo i, 1:part of the law of the land. These amendments provided, among other
2mo i, 1:things, that Congress could make no law respecting the establishment of
2mo i, 1:religion, abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right
2mo i, 1:of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the government for a
2mo i, 1:redress of grievances. They also guaranteed indictment by grand jury and
2mo i, 1:trial by jury for all persons charged by federal officers with serious
2mo i, 1:crimes. To reassure those who still feared that local rights might be
2mo i, 1:invaded by the federal government, the tenth amendment expressly
2mo i, 1:provided that the powers not delegated to the United States by the
2mo i, 1:Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the
2mo i, 1:states respectively or to the people. Seven years later, the eleventh
2mo i, 1:amendment was written in the same spirit as the first ten, after a
2mo i, 1:heated debate over the action of the Supreme Court in permitting a
2mo i, 1:citizen to bring a suit against "the sovereign state" of Georgia. The
2mo i, 1:new amendment was designed to protect states against the federal
2mo i, 1:judiciary by forbidding it to hear any case in which a state was sued by
2mo i, 1:a citizen.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Funding the National Debt.=--Paper declarations of rights, however,
2mo i, 1:paid no bills. To this task Hamilton turned all his splendid genius. At
2mo i, 1:the very outset he addressed himself to the problem of the huge public
2mo i, 1:debt, daily mounting as the unpaid interest accumulated. In a _Report on
2mo i, 1:Public Credit_ under date of January 9, 1790, one of the first and
2mo i, 1:greatest of American state papers, he laid before Congress the outlines
2mo i, 1:of his plan. He proposed that the federal government should call in all
2mo i, 1:the old bonds, certificates of indebtedness, and other promises to pay
2mo i, 1:which had been issued by the Congress since the beginning of the
2mo i, 1:Revolution. These national obligations, he urged, should be put into one
2mo i, 1:consolidated debt resting on the credit of the United States; to the
2mo i, 1:holders of the old paper should be issued new bonds drawing interest at
2mo i, 1:fixed rates. This process was called "funding the debt." Such a
2mo i, 1:provision for the support of public credit, Hamilton insisted, would
2mo i, 1:satisfy creditors, restore landed property to its former value, and
2mo i, 1:furnish new resources to agriculture and commerce in the form of credit
2mo i, 1:and capital.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Assumption and Funding of State Debts.=--Hamilton then turned to the
2mo i, 1:obligations incurred by the several states in support of the Revolution.
2mo i, 1:These debts he proposed to add to the national debt. They were to be
2mo i, 1:"assumed" by the United States government and placed on the same secure
2mo i, 1:foundation as the continental debt. This measure he defended not merely
2mo i, 1:on grounds of national honor. It would, as he foresaw, give strength to
2mo i, 1:the new national government by making all public creditors, men of
2mo i, 1:substance in their several communities, look to the federal, rather than
2mo i, 1:the state government, for the satisfaction of their claims.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Funding at Face Value.=--On the question of the terms of consolidation,
2mo i, 1:assumption, and funding, Hamilton had a firm conviction. That millions
2mo i, 1:of dollars' worth of the continental and state bonds had passed out of
2mo i, 1:the hands of those who had originally subscribed their funds to the
2mo i, 1:support of the government or had sold supplies for the Revolutionary
2mo i, 1:army was well known. It was also a matter of common knowledge that a
2mo i, 1:very large part of these bonds had been bought by speculators at ruinous
2mo i, 1:figures--ten, twenty, and thirty cents on the dollar. Accordingly, it
2mo i, 1:had been suggested, even in very respectable quarters, that a
2mo i, 1:discrimination should be made between original holders and speculative
2mo i, 1:purchasers. Some who held this opinion urged that the speculators who
2mo i, 1:had paid nominal sums for their bonds should be reimbursed for their
2mo i, 1:outlays and the original holders paid the difference; others said that
2mo i, 1:the government should "scale the debt" by redeeming, not at full value
2mo i, 1:but at a figure reasonably above the market price. Against the
2mo i, 1:proposition Hamilton set his face like flint. He maintained that the
2mo i, 1:government was honestly bound to redeem every bond at its face value,
2mo i, 1:although the difficulty of securing revenue made necessary a lower rate
2mo i, 1:of interest on a part of the bonds and the deferring of interest on
2mo i, 1:another part.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Funding and Assumption Carried.=--There was little difficulty in
2mo i, 1:securing the approval of both houses of Congress for the funding of the
2mo i, 1:national debt at full value. The bill for the assumption of state debts,
2mo i, 1:however, brought the sharpest division of opinions. To the Southern
2mo i, 1:members of Congress assumption was a gross violation of states' rights,
2mo i, 1:without any warrant in the Constitution and devised in the interest of
2mo i, 1:Northern speculators who, anticipating assumption and funding, had
2mo i, 1:bought up at low prices the Southern bonds and other promises to pay.
2mo i, 1:New England, on the other hand, was strongly in favor of assumption;
2mo i, 1:several representatives from that section were rash enough to threaten a
2mo i, 1:dissolution of the union if the bill was defeated. To this dispute was
2mo i, 1:added an equally bitter quarrel over the location of the national
2mo i, 1:capital, then temporarily at New York City.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: FIRST UNITED STATES BANK AT PHILADELPHIA]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:A deadlock, accompanied by the most surly feelings on both sides,
2mo i, 1:threatened the very existence of the young government. Washington and
2mo i, 1:Hamilton were thoroughly alarmed. Hearing of the extremity to which the
2mo i, 1:contest had been carried and acting on the appeal from the Secretary of
2mo i, 1:the Treasury, Jefferson intervened at this point. By skillful management
2mo i, 1:at a good dinner he brought the opposing leaders together; and thus once
2mo i, 1:more, as on many other occasions, peace was purchased and the union
2mo i, 1:saved by compromise. The bargain this time consisted of an exchange of
2mo i, 1:votes for assumption in return for votes for the capital. Enough
2mo i, 1:Southern members voted for assumption to pass the bill, and a majority
2mo i, 1:was mustered in favor of building the capital on the banks of the
2mo i, 1:Potomac, after locating it for a ten-year period at Philadelphia to
2mo i, 1:satisfy Pennsylvania members.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The United States Bank.=--Encouraged by the success of his funding and
2mo i, 1:assumption measures, Hamilton laid before Congress a project for a great
2mo i, 1:United States Bank. He proposed that a private corporation be chartered
2mo i, 1:by Congress, authorized to raise a capital stock of $10,000,000
2mo i, 1:(three-fourths in new six per cent federal bonds and one-fourth in
2mo i, 1:specie) and empowered to issue paper currency under proper safeguards.
2mo i, 1:Many advantages, Hamilton contended, would accrue to the government from
2mo i, 1:this institution. The price of the government bonds would be increased,
2mo i, 1:thus enhancing public credit. A national currency would be created of
2mo i, 1:uniform value from one end of the land to the other. The branches of the
2mo i, 1:bank in various cities would make easy the exchange of funds so vital to
2mo i, 1:commercial transactions on a national scale. Finally, through the issue
2mo i, 1:of bank notes, the money capital available for agriculture and industry
2mo i, 1:would be increased, thus stimulating business enterprise. Jefferson
2mo i, 1:hotly attacked the bank on the ground that Congress had no power
2mo i, 1:whatever under the Constitution to charter such a private corporation.
2mo i, 1:Hamilton defended it with great cogency. Washington, after weighing all
2mo i, 1:opinions, decided in favor of the proposal. In 1791 the bill
2mo i, 1:establishing the first United States Bank for a period of twenty years
2mo i, 1:became a law.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Protective Tariff.=--A third part of Hamilton's program was the
2mo i, 1:protection of American industries. The first revenue act of 1789, though
2mo i, 1:designed primarily to bring money into the empty treasury, declared in
2mo i, 1:favor of the principle. The following year Washington referred to the
2mo i, 1:subject in his address to Congress. Thereupon Hamilton was instructed to
2mo i, 1:prepare recommendations for legislative action. The result, after a
2mo i, 1:delay of more than a year, was his _Report on Manufactures_, another
2mo i, 1:state paper worthy, in closeness of reasoning and keenness of
2mo i, 1:understanding, of a place beside his report on public credit. Hamilton
2mo i, 1:based his argument on the broadest national grounds: the protective
2mo i, 1:tariff would, by encouraging the building of factories, create a home
2mo i, 1:market for the produce of farms and plantations; by making the United
2mo i, 1:States independent of other countries in times of peace, it would double
2mo i, 1:its security in time of war; by making use of the labor of women and
2mo i, 1:children, it would turn to the production of goods persons otherwise
2mo i, 1:idle or only partly employed; by increasing the trade between the North
2mo i, 1:and South it would strengthen the links of union and add to political
2mo i, 1:ties those of commerce and intercourse. The revenue measure of 1792 bore
2mo i, 1:the impress of these arguments.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE RISE OF POLITICAL PARTIES
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Dissensions over Hamilton's Measures.=--Hamilton's plans, touching
2mo i, 1:deeply as they did the resources of individuals and the interests of the
2mo i, 1:states, awakened alarm and opposition. Funding at face value, said his
2mo i, 1:critics, was a government favor to speculators; the assumption of state
2mo i, 1:debts was a deep design to undermine the state governments; Congress had
2mo i, 1:no constitutional power to create a bank; the law creating the bank
2mo i, 1:merely allowed a private corporation to make paper money and lend it at
2mo i, 1:a high rate of interest; and the tariff was a tax on land and labor for
2mo i, 1:the benefit of manufacturers.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Hamilton's reply to this bill of indictment was simple and
2mo i, 1:straightforward. Some rascally speculators had profited from the funding
2mo i, 1:of the debt at face value, but that was only an incident in the
2mo i, 1:restoration of public credit. In view of the jealousies of the states it
2mo i, 1:was a good thing to reduce their powers and pretensions. The
2mo i, 1:Constitution was not to be interpreted narrowly but in the full light of
2mo i, 1:national needs. The bank would enlarge the amount of capital so sorely
2mo i, 1:needed to start up American industries, giving markets to farmers and
2mo i, 1:planters. The tariff by creating a home market and increasing
2mo i, 1:opportunities for employment would benefit both land and labor. Out of
2mo i, 1:such wise policies firmly pursued by the government, he concluded, were
2mo i, 1:bound to come strength and prosperity for the new government at home,
2mo i, 1:credit and power abroad. This view Washington fully indorsed, adding
2mo i, 1:the weight of his great name to the inherent merits of the measures
2mo i, 1:adopted under his administration.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Sharpness of the Partisan Conflict.=--As a result of the clash of
2mo i, 1:opinion, the people of the country gradually divided into two parties:
2mo i, 1:Federalists and Anti-Federalists, the former led by Hamilton, the latter
2mo i, 1:by Jefferson. The strength of the Federalists lay in the cities--Boston,
2mo i, 1:Providence, Hartford, New York, Philadelphia, Charleston--among the
2mo i, 1:manufacturing, financial, and commercial groups of the population who
2mo i, 1:were eager to extend their business operations. The strength of the
2mo i, 1:Anti-Federalists lay mainly among the debt-burdened farmers who feared
2mo i, 1:the growth of what they called "a money power" and planters in all
2mo i, 1:sections who feared the dominance of commercial and manufacturing
2mo i, 1:interests. The farming and planting South, outside of the few towns,
2mo i, 1:finally presented an almost solid front against assumption, the bank,
2mo i, 1:and the tariff. The conflict between the parties grew steadily in
2mo i, 1:bitterness, despite the conciliatory and engaging manner in which
2mo i, 1:Hamilton presented his cause in his state papers and despite the
2mo i, 1:constant efforts of Washington to soften the asperity of the
2mo i, 1:contestants.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Leadership and Doctrines of Jefferson.=--The party dispute had not
2mo i, 1:gone far before the opponents of the administration began to look to
2mo i, 1:Jefferson as their leader. Some of Hamilton's measures he had approved,
2mo i, 1:declaring afterward that he did not at the time understand their
2mo i, 1:significance. Others, particularly the bank, he fiercely assailed. More
2mo i, 1:than once, he and Hamilton, shaking violently with anger, attacked each
2mo i, 1:other at cabinet meetings, and nothing short of the grave and dignified
2mo i, 1:pleas of Washington prevented an early and open break between them. In
2mo i, 1:1794 it finally came. Jefferson resigned as Secretary of State and
2mo i, 1:retired to his home in Virginia to assume, through correspondence and
2mo i, 1:negotiation, the leadership of the steadily growing party of opposition.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Shy and modest in manner, halting in speech, disliking the turmoil of
2mo i, 1:public debate, and deeply interested in science and philosophy,
2mo i, 1:Jefferson was not very well fitted for the strenuous life of political
2mo i, 1:contest. Nevertheless, he was an ambitious and shrewd negotiator. He was
2mo i, 1:also by honest opinion and matured conviction the exact opposite of
2mo i, 1:Hamilton. The latter believed in a strong, active, "high-toned"
2mo i, 1:government, vigorously compelling in all its branches. Jefferson looked
2mo i, 1:upon such government as dangerous to the liberties of citizens and
2mo i, 1:openly avowed his faith in the desirability of occasional popular
2mo i, 1:uprisings. Hamilton distrusted the people. "Your people is a great
2mo i, 1:beast," he is reported to have said. Jefferson professed his faith in
2mo i, 1:the people with an abandon that was considered reckless in his time.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:On economic matters, the opinions of the two leaders were also
2mo i, 1:hopelessly at variance. Hamilton, while cherishing agriculture, desired
2mo i, 1:to see America a great commercial and industrial nation. Jefferson was
2mo i, 1:equally set against this course for his country. He feared the
2mo i, 1:accumulation of riches and the growth of a large urban working class.
2mo i, 1:The mobs of great cities, he said, are sores on the body politic;
2mo i, 1:artisans are usually the dangerous element that make revolutions;
2mo i, 1:workshops should be kept in Europe and with them the artisans with their
2mo i, 1:insidious morals and manners. The only substantial foundation for a
2mo i, 1:republic, Jefferson believed to be agriculture. The spirit of
2mo i, 1:independence could be kept alive only by free farmers, owning the land
2mo i, 1:they tilled and looking to the sun in heaven and the labor of their
2mo i, 1:hands for their sustenance. Trusting as he did in the innate goodness of
2mo i, 1:human nature when nourished on a free soil, Jefferson advocated those
2mo i, 1:measures calculated to favor agriculture and to enlarge the rights of
2mo i, 1:persons rather than the powers of government. Thus he became the
2mo i, 1:champion of the individual against the interference of the government,
2mo i, 1:and an ardent advocate of freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and
2mo i, 1:freedom of scientific inquiry. It was, accordingly, no mere factious
2mo i, 1:spirit that drove him into opposition to Hamilton.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Whisky Rebellion.=--The political agitation of the Anti-Federalists
2mo i, 1:was accompanied by an armed revolt against the government in 1794. The
2mo i, 1:occasion for this uprising was another of Hamilton's measures, a law
2mo i, 1:laying an excise tax on distilled spirits, for the purpose of increasing
2mo i, 1:the revenue needed to pay the interest on the funded debt. It so
2mo i, 1:happened that a very considerable part of the whisky manufactured in the
2mo i, 1:country was made by the farmers, especially on the frontier, in their
2mo i, 1:own stills. The new revenue law meant that federal officers would now
2mo i, 1:come into the homes of the people, measure their liquor, and take the
2mo i, 1:tax out of their pockets. All the bitterness which farmers felt against
2mo i, 1:the fiscal measures of the government was redoubled. In the western
2mo i, 1:districts of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina, they refused to
2mo i, 1:pay the tax. In Pennsylvania, some of them sacked and burned the houses
2mo i, 1:of the tax collectors, as the Revolutionists thirty years before had
2mo i, 1:mobbed the agents of King George sent over to sell stamps. They were in
2mo i, 1:a fair way to nullify the law in whole districts when Washington called
2mo i, 1:out the troops to suppress "the Whisky Rebellion." Then the movement
2mo i, 1:collapsed; but it left behind a deep-seated resentment which flared up
2mo i, 1:in the election of several obdurate Anti-Federalist Congressmen from the
2mo i, 1:disaffected regions.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:FOREIGN INFLUENCES AND DOMESTIC POLITICS
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The French Revolution.=--In this exciting period, when all America was
2mo i, 1:distracted by partisan disputes, a storm broke in Europe--the
2mo i, 1:epoch-making French Revolution--which not only shook the thrones of the
2mo i, 1:Old World but stirred to its depths the young republic of the New World.
2mo i, 1:The first scene in this dramatic affair occurred in the spring of 1789,
2mo i, 1:a few days after Washington was inaugurated. The king of France, Louis
2mo i, 1:XVI, driven into bankruptcy by extravagance and costly wars, was forced
2mo i, 1:to resort to his people for financial help. Accordingly he called, for
2mo i, 1:the first time in more than one hundred fifty years, a meeting of the
2mo i, 1:national parliament, the "Estates General," composed of representatives
2mo i, 1:of the "three estates"--the clergy, nobility, and commoners. Acting
2mo i, 1:under powerful leaders, the commoners, or "third estate," swept aside
2mo i, 1:the clergy and nobility and resolved themselves into a national
2mo i, 1:assembly. This stirred the country to its depths.

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Great events followed in swift succession. On July 14, 1789, the
2mo i, 1:Bastille, an old royal prison, symbol of the king's absolutism, was
2mo i, 1:stormed by a Paris crowd and destroyed. On the night of August 4, the
2mo i, 1:feudal privileges of the nobility were abolished by the national
2mo i, 1:assembly amid great excitement. A few days later came the famous
2mo i, 1:Declaration of the Rights of Man, proclaiming the sovereignty of the
2mo i, 1:people and the privileges of citizens. In the autumn of 1791, Louis XVI
2mo i, 1:was forced to accept a new constitution for France vesting the
2mo i, 1:legislative power in a popular assembly. Little disorder accompanied
2mo i, 1:these startling changes. To all appearances a peaceful revolution had
2mo i, 1:stripped the French king of his royal prerogatives and based the
2mo i, 1:government of his country on the consent of the governed.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=American Influence in France.=--In undertaking their great political
2mo i, 1:revolt the French had been encouraged by the outcome of the American
2mo i, 1:Revolution. Officers and soldiers, who had served in the American war,
2mo i, 1:reported to their French countrymen marvelous tales. At the frugal table
2mo i, 1:of General Washington, in council with the unpretentious Franklin, or at
2mo i, 1:conferences over the strategy of war, French noblemen of ancient lineage
2mo i, 1:learned to respect both the talents and the simple character of the
2mo i, 1:leaders in the great republican commonwealth beyond the seas. Travelers,
2mo i, 1:who had gone to see the experiment in republicanism with their own eyes,
2mo i, 1:carried home to the king and ruling class stories of an astounding
2mo i, 1:system of popular government.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:On the other hand the dalliance with American democracy was regarded by
2mo i, 1:French conservatives as playing with fire. "When we think of the false
2mo i, 1:ideas of government and philanthropy," wrote one of Lafayette's aides,
2mo i, 1:"which these youths acquired in America and propagated in France with so
2mo i, 1:much enthusiasm and such deplorable success--for this mania of imitation
2mo i, 1:powerfully aided the Revolution, though it was not the sole cause of
2mo i, 1:it--we are bound to confess that it would have been better, both for
2mo i, 1:themselves and for us, if these young philosophers in red-heeled shoes
2mo i, 1:had stayed at home in attendance on the court."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Early American Opinion of the French Revolution.=--So close were the
2mo i, 1:ties between the two nations that it is not surprising to find every
2mo i, 1:step in the first stages of the French Revolution greeted with applause
2mo i, 1:in the United States. "Liberty will have another feather in her cap,"
2mo i, 1:exultantly wrote a Boston editor. "In no part of the globe," soberly
2mo i, 1:wrote John Marshall, "was this revolution hailed with more joy than in
2mo i, 1:America.... But one sentiment existed." The main key to the Bastille,
2mo i, 1:sent to Washington as a memento, was accepted as "a token of the
2mo i, 1:victory gained by liberty." Thomas Paine saw in the great event "the
2mo i, 1:first ripe fruits of American principles transplanted into Europe."
2mo i, 1:Federalists and Anti-Federalists regarded the new constitution of France
2mo i, 1:as another vindication of American ideals.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Reign of Terror.=--While profuse congratulations were being
2mo i, 1:exchanged, rumors began to come that all was not well in France. Many
2mo i, 1:noblemen, enraged at the loss of their special privileges, fled into
2mo i, 1:Germany and plotted an invasion of France to overthrow the new system of
2mo i, 1:government. Louis XVI entered into negotiations with his brother
2mo i, 1:monarchs on the continent to secure their help in the same enterprise,
2mo i, 1:and he finally betrayed to the French people his true sentiments by
2mo i, 1:attempting to escape from his kingdom, only to be captured and taken
2mo i, 1:back to Paris in disgrace.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:A new phase of the revolution now opened. The working people, excluded
2mo i, 1:from all share in the government by the first French constitution,
2mo i, 1:became restless, especially in Paris. Assembling on the Champs de Mars,
2mo i, 1:a great open field, they signed a petition calling for another
2mo i, 1:constitution giving them the suffrage. When told to disperse, they
2mo i, 1:refused and were fired upon by the national guard. This "massacre," as
2mo i, 1:it was called, enraged the populace. A radical party, known as
2mo i, 1:"Jacobins," then sprang up, taking its name from a Jacobin monastery in
2mo i, 1:which it held its sessions. In a little while it became the master of
2mo i, 1:the popular convention convoked in September, 1792. The monarchy was
2mo i, 1:immediately abolished and a republic established. On January 21, 1793,
2mo i, 1:Louis was sent to the scaffold. To the war on Austria, already raging,
2mo i, 1:was added a war on England. Then came the Reign of Terror, during which
2mo i, 1:radicals in possession of the convention executed in large numbers
2mo i, 1:counter-revolutionists and those suspected of sympathy with the
2mo i, 1:monarchy. They shot down peasants who rose in insurrection against their
2mo i, 1:rule and established a relentless dictatorship. Civil war followed.
2mo i, 1:Terrible atrocities were committed on both sides in the name of liberty,
2mo i, 1:and in the name of monarchy. To Americans of conservative temper it now
2mo i, 1:seemed that the Revolution, so auspiciously begun, had degenerated into
2mo i, 1:anarchy and mere bloodthirsty strife.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Burke Summons the World to War on France.=--In England, Edmund Burke
2mo i, 1:led the fight against the new French principles which he feared might
2mo i, 1:spread to all Europe. In his _Reflections on the French Revolution_,
2mo i, 1:written in 1790, he attacked with terrible wrath the whole program of
2mo i, 1:popular government; he called for war, relentless war, upon the French
2mo i, 1:as monsters and outlaws; he demanded that they be reduced to order by
2mo i, 1:the restoration of the king to full power under the protection of the
2mo i, 1:arms of European nations.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Paine's Defense of the French Revolution.=--To counteract the campaign
2mo i, 1:of hate against the French, Thomas Paine replied to Burke in another of
2mo i, 1:his famous tracts, _The Rights of Man_, which was given to the American
2mo i, 1:public in an edition containing a letter of approval from Jefferson.
2mo i, 1:Burke, said Paine, had been mourning about the glories of the French
2mo i, 1:monarchy and aristocracy but had forgotten the starving peasants and the
2mo i, 1:oppressed people; had wept over the plumage and neglected the dying
2mo i, 1:bird. Burke had denied the right of the French people to choose their
2mo i, 1:own governors, blandly forgetting that the English government in which
2mo i, 1:he saw final perfection itself rested on two revolutions. He had boasted
2mo i, 1:that the king of England held his crown in contempt of the democratic
2mo i, 1:societies. Paine answered: "If I ask a man in America if he wants a
2mo i, 1:king, he retorts and asks me if I take him for an idiot." To the charge
2mo i, 1:that the doctrines of the rights of man were "new fangled," Paine
2mo i, 1:replied that the question was not whether they were new or old but
2mo i, 1:whether they were right or wrong. As to the French disorders and
2mo i, 1:difficulties, he bade the world wait to see what would be brought forth
2mo i, 1:in due time.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Effect of the French Revolution on American Politics.=--The course
2mo i, 1:of the French Revolution and the controversies accompanying it,
2mo i, 1:exercised a profound influence on the formation of the first political
2mo i, 1:parties in America. The followers of Hamilton, now proud of the name
2mo i, 1:"Federalists," drew back in fright as they heard of the cruel deeds
2mo i, 1:committed during the Reign of Terror. They turned savagely upon the
2mo i, 1:revolutionists and their friends in America, denouncing as "Jacobin"
2mo i, 1:everybody who did not condemn loudly enough the proceedings of the
2mo i, 1:French Republic. A Massachusetts preacher roundly assailed "the
2mo i, 1:atheistical, anarchical, and in other respects immoral principles of the
2mo i, 1:French Republicans"; he then proceeded with equal passion to attack
2mo i, 1:Jefferson and the Anti-Federalists, whom he charged with spreading false
2mo i, 1:French propaganda and betraying America. "The editors, patrons, and
2mo i, 1:abettors of these vehicles of slander," he exclaimed, "ought to be
2mo i, 1:considered and treated as enemies to their country.... Of all traitors
2mo i, 1:they are the most aggravatedly criminal; of all villains, they are the
2mo i, 1:most infamous and detestable."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The Anti-Federalists, as a matter of fact, were generally favorable to
2mo i, 1:the Revolution although they deplored many of the events associated with
2mo i, 1:it. Paine's pamphlet, indorsed by Jefferson, was widely read. Democratic
2mo i, 1:societies, after the fashion of French political clubs, arose in the
2mo i, 1:cities; the coalition of European monarchs against France was denounced
2mo i, 1:as a coalition against the very principles of republicanism; and the
2mo i, 1:execution of Louis XVI was openly celebrated at a banquet in
2mo i, 1:Philadelphia. Harmless titles, such as "Sir," "the Honorable," and "His
2mo i, 1:Excellency," were decried as aristocratic and some of the more excited
2mo i, 1:insisted on adopting the French title, "Citizen," speaking, for example,
2mo i, 1:of "Citizen Judge" and "Citizen Toastmaster." Pamphlets in defense of
2mo i, 1:the French streamed from the press, while subsidized newspapers kept the
2mo i, 1:propaganda in full swing.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The European War Disturbs American Commerce.=--This battle of wits, or
2mo i, 1:rather contest in calumny, might have gone on indefinitely in America
2mo i, 1:without producing any serious results, had it not been for the war
2mo i, 1:between England and France, then raging. The English, having command of
2mo i, 1:the seas, claimed the right to seize American produce bound for French
2mo i, 1:ports and to confiscate American ships engaged in carrying French goods.
2mo i, 1:Adding fuel to a fire already hot enough, they began to search American
2mo i, 1:ships and to carry off British-born sailors found on board American
2mo i, 1:vessels.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The French Appeal for Help.=--At the same time the French Republic
2mo i, 1:turned to the United States for aid in its war on England and sent over
2mo i, 1:as its diplomatic representative "Citizen" Genet, an ardent supporter of
2mo i, 1:the new order. On his arrival at Charleston, he was greeted with fervor
2mo i, 1:by the Anti-Federalists. As he made his way North, he was wined and
2mo i, 1:dined and given popular ovations that turned his head. He thought the
2mo i, 1:whole country was ready to join the French Republic in its contest with
2mo i, 1:England. Genet therefore attempted to use the American ports as the base
2mo i, 1:of operations for French privateers preying on British merchant ships;
2mo i, 1:and he insisted that the United States was in honor bound to help France
2mo i, 1:under the treaty of 1778.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Proclamation of Neutrality and the Jay Treaty.=--Unmoved by the
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:rising tide of popular sympathy for France, Washington took a firm
2mo i, 1:course. He received Genet coldly. The demand that the United States aid
2mo i, 1:France under the old treaty of alliance he answered by proclaiming the
2mo i, 1:neutrality of America and warning American citizens against hostile acts
2mo i, 1:toward either France or England. When Genet continued to hold meetings,
2mo i, 1:issue manifestoes, and stir up the people against England, Washington
2mo i, 1:asked the French government to recall him. This act he followed up by
2mo i, 1:sending the Chief Justice, John Jay, on a pacific mission to England.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The result was the celebrated Jay treaty of 1794. By its terms Great
2mo i, 1:Britain agreed to withdraw her troops from the western forts where they
2mo i, 1:had been since the war for independence and to grant certain slight
2mo i, 1:trade concessions. The chief sources of bitterness--the failure of the
2mo i, 1:British to return slaves carried off during the Revolution, the seizure
2mo i, 1:of American ships, and the impressment of sailors--were not touched,
2mo i, 1:much to the distress of everybody in America, including loyal
2mo i, 1:Federalists. Nevertheless, Washington, dreading an armed conflict with
2mo i, 1:England, urged the Senate to ratify the treaty. The weight of his
2mo i, 1:influence carried the day.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:At this, the hostility of the Anti-Federalists knew no bounds. Jefferson
2mo i, 1:declared the Jay treaty "an infamous act which is really nothing more
2mo i, 1:than an alliance between England and the Anglo-men of this country,
2mo i, 1:against the legislature and the people of the United States." Hamilton,
2mo i, 1:defending it with his usual courage, was stoned by a mob in New York and
2mo i, 1:driven from the platform with blood streaming from his face. Jay was
2mo i, 1:burned in effigy. Even Washington was not spared. The House of
2mo i, 1:Representatives was openly hostile. To display its feelings, it called
2mo i, 1:upon the President for the papers relative to the treaty negotiations,
2mo i, 1:only to be more highly incensed by his flat refusal to present them, on
2mo i, 1:the ground that the House did not share in the treaty-making power.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Washington Retires from Politics.=--Such angry contests confirmed the
2mo i, 1:President in his slowly maturing determination to retire at the end of
2mo i, 1:his second term in office. He did not believe that a third term was
2mo i, 1:unconstitutional or improper; but, worn out by his long and arduous
2mo i, 1:labors in war and in peace and wounded by harsh attacks from former
2mo i, 1:friends, he longed for the quiet of his beautiful estate at Mount
2mo i, 1:Vernon.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In September, 1796, on the eve of the presidential election, Washington
2mo i, 1:issued his Farewell Address, another state paper to be treasured and
2mo i, 1:read by generations of Americans to come. In this address he directed
2mo i, 1:the attention of the people to three subjects of lasting interest. He
2mo i, 1:warned them against sectional jealousies. He remonstrated against the
2mo i, 1:spirit of partisanship, saying that in government "of the popular
2mo i, 1:character, in government purely elective, it is a spirit not to be
2mo i, 1:encouraged." He likewise cautioned the people against "the insidious
2mo i, 1:wiles of foreign influence," saying: "Europe has a set of primary
2mo i, 1:interests which to us have none or a very remote relation. Hence she
2mo i, 1:must be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are
2mo i, 1:essentially foreign to our concerns. Hence, therefore, it would be
2mo i, 1:unwise in us to implicate ourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary
2mo i, 1:vicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions
2mo i, 1:of her friendships or enmities.... Why forego the advantages of so
2mo i, 1:peculiar a situation?... It is our true policy to steer clear of
2mo i, 1:permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world.... Taking
2mo i, 1:care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on a
2mo i, 1:respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary
2mo i, 1:alliances for extraordinary emergencies."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Campaign of 1796--Adams Elected.=--On hearing of the retirement of
2mo i, 1:Washington, the Anti-Federalists cast off all restraints. In honor of
2mo i, 1:France and in opposition to what they were pleased to call the
2mo i, 1:monarchical tendencies of the Federalists, they boldly assumed the name
2mo i, 1:"Republican"; the term "Democrat," then applied only to obscure and
2mo i, 1:despised radicals, had not come into general use. They selected
2mo i, 1:Jefferson as their candidate for President against John Adams, the
2mo i, 1:Federalist nominee, and carried on such a spirited campaign that they
2mo i, 1:came within four votes of electing him.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The successful candidate, Adams, was not fitted by training or opinion
2mo i, 1:for conciliating a determined opposition. He was a reserved and studious
2mo i, 1:man. He was neither a good speaker nor a skillful negotiator. In one of
2mo i, 1:his books he had declared himself in favor of "government by an
2mo i, 1:aristocracy of talents and wealth"--an offense which the Republicans
2mo i, 1:never forgave. While John Marshall found him "a sensible, plain, candid,
2mo i, 1:good-tempered man," Jefferson could see in him nothing but a "monocrat"
2mo i, 1:and "Anglo-man." Had it not been for the conduct of the French
2mo i, 1:government, Adams would hardly have enjoyed a moment's genuine
2mo i, 1:popularity during his administration.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Quarrel with France.=--The French Directory, the executive
2mo i, 1:department established under the constitution of 1795, managed, however,
2mo i, 1:to stir the anger of Republicans and Federalists alike. It regarded the
2mo i, 1:Jay treaty as a rebuke to France and a flagrant violation of obligations
2mo i, 1:solemnly registered in the treaty of 1778. Accordingly it refused to
2mo i, 1:receive the American minister, treated him in a humiliating way, and
2mo i, 1:finally told him to leave the country. Overlooking this affront in his
2mo i, 1:anxiety to maintain peace, Adams dispatched to France a commission of
2mo i, 1:eminent men with instructions to reach an understanding with the French
2mo i, 1:Republic. On their arrival, they were chagrined to find, instead of a
2mo i, 1:decent reception, an indirect demand for an apology respecting the past
2mo i, 1:conduct of the American government, a payment in cash, and an annual
2mo i, 1:tribute as the price of continued friendship. When the news of this
2mo i, 1:affair reached President Adams, he promptly laid it before Congress,
2mo i, 1:referring to the Frenchmen who had made the demands as "Mr. X, Mr. Y,
2mo i, 1:and Mr. Z."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:This insult, coupled with the fact that French privateers, like the
2mo i, 1:British, were preying upon American commerce, enraged even the
2mo i, 1:Republicans who had been loudest in the profession of their French
2mo i, 1:sympathies. They forgot their wrath over the Jay treaty and joined with
2mo i, 1:the Federalists in shouting: "Millions for defense, not a cent for
2mo i, 1:tribute!" Preparations for war were made on every hand. Washington was
2mo i, 1:once more called from Mount Vernon to take his old position at the head
2mo i, 1:of the army. Indeed, fighting actually began upon the high seas and went
2mo i, 1:on without a formal declaration of war until the year 1800. By that time
2mo i, 1:the Directory had been overthrown. A treaty was readily made with
2mo i, 1:Napoleon, the First Consul, who was beginning his remarkable career as
2mo i, 1:chief of the French Republic, soon to be turned into an empire.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Alien and Sedition Laws.=--Flushed with success, the Federalists
2mo i, 1:determined, if possible, to put an end to radical French influence in
2mo i, 1:America and to silence Republican opposition. They therefore passed two
2mo i, 1:drastic laws in the summer of 1798: the Alien and Sedition Acts.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The first of these measures empowered the President to expel from the
2mo i, 1:country or to imprison any alien whom he regarded as "dangerous" or "had
2mo i, 1:reasonable grounds to suspect" of "any treasonable or secret
2mo i, 1:machinations against the government."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The second of the measures, the Sedition Act, penalized not only those
2mo i, 1:who attempted to stir up unlawful combinations against the government
2mo i, 1:but also every one who wrote, uttered, or published "any false,
2mo i, 1:scandalous, and malicious writing ... against the government of the
2mo i, 1:United States or either House of Congress, or the President of the
2mo i, 1:United States, with intent to defame said government ... or to bring
2mo i, 1:them or either of them into contempt or disrepute." This measure was
2mo i, 1:hurried through Congress in spite of the opposition and the clear
2mo i, 1:provision in the Constitution that Congress shall make no law abridging
2mo i, 1:the freedom of speech or of the press. Even many Federalists feared the
2mo i, 1:consequences of the action. Hamilton was alarmed when he read the bill,
2mo i, 1:exclaiming: "Let us not establish a tyranny. Energy is a very different
2mo i, 1:thing from violence." John Marshall told his friends in Virginia that,
2mo i, 1:had he been in Congress, he would have opposed the two bills because he
2mo i, 1:thought them "useless" and "calculated to create unnecessary discontents
2mo i, 1:and jealousies."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The Alien law was not enforced; but it gave great offense to the Irish
2mo i, 1:and French whose activities against the American government's policy
2mo i, 1:respecting Great Britain put them in danger of prison. The Sedition law,
2mo i, 1:on the other hand, was vigorously applied. Several editors of Republican
2mo i, 1:newspapers soon found themselves in jail or broken by ruinous fines for
2mo i, 1:their caustic criticisms of the Federalist President and his policies.
2mo i, 1:Bystanders at political meetings, who uttered sentiments which, though
2mo i, 1:ungenerous and severe, seem harmless enough now, were hurried before
2mo i, 1:Federalist judges and promptly fined and imprisoned. Although the
2mo i, 1:prosecutions were not numerous, they aroused a keen resentment. The
2mo i, 1:Republicans were convinced that their political opponents, having
2mo i, 1:saddled upon the country Hamilton's fiscal system and the British
2mo i, 1:treaty, were bent on silencing all censure. The measures therefore had
2mo i, 1:exactly the opposite effect from that which their authors intended.
2mo i, 1:Instead of helping the Federalist party, they made criticism of it more
2mo i, 1:bitter than ever.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions.=--Jefferson was quick to take
2mo i, 1:advantage of the discontent. He drafted a set of resolutions declaring
2mo i, 1:the Sedition law null and void, as violating the federal Constitution.
2mo i, 1:His resolutions were passed by the Kentucky legislature late in 1798,
2mo i, 1:signed by the governor, and transmitted to the other states for their
2mo i, 1:consideration. Though receiving unfavorable replies from a number of
2mo i, 1:Northern states, Kentucky the following year reaffirmed its position and
2mo i, 1:declared that the nullification of all unconstitutional acts of Congress
2mo i, 1:was the rightful remedy to be used by the states in the redress of
2mo i, 1:grievances. It thus defied the federal government and announced a
2mo i, 1:doctrine hostile to nationality and fraught with terrible meaning for
2mo i, 1:the future. In the neighboring state of Virginia, Madison led a movement
2mo i, 1:against the Alien and Sedition laws. He induced the legislature to pass
2mo i, 1:resolutions condemning the acts as unconstitutional and calling upon the
2mo i, 1:other states to take proper means to preserve their rights and the
2mo i, 1:rights of the people.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Republican Triumph in 1800.=--Thus the way was prepared for the
2mo i, 1:election of 1800. The Republicans left no stone unturned in their
2mo i, 1:efforts to place on the Federalist candidate, President Adams, all the
2mo i, 1:odium of the Alien and Sedition laws, in addition to responsibility for
2mo i, 1:approving Hamilton's measures and policies. The Federalists, divided in
2mo i, 1:councils and cold in their affection for Adams, made a poor campaign.
2mo i, 1:They tried to discredit their opponents with epithets of "Jacobins" and
2mo i, 1:"Anarchists"--terms which had been weakened by excessive use. When the
2mo i, 1:vote was counted, it was found that Adams had been defeated; while the
2mo i, 1:Republicans had carried the entire South and New York also and secured
2mo i, 1:eight of the fifteen electoral votes cast by Pennsylvania. "Our beloved
2mo i, 1:Adams will now close his bright career," lamented a Federalist
2mo i, 1:newspaper. "Sons of faction, demagogues and high priests of anarchy, now
2mo i, 1:you have cause to triumph!"

2mo i, 1:A QUARREL BETWEEN A FEDERALIST AND A REPUBLICAN IN THE HOUSE OF
2mo i, 1:REPRESENTATIVES]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Jefferson's election, however, was still uncertain. By a curious
2mo i, 1:provision in the Constitution, presidential electors were required to
2mo i, 1:vote for two persons without indicating which office each was to fill,
2mo i, 1:the one receiving the highest number of votes to be President and the
2mo i, 1:candidate standing next to be Vice President. It so happened that Aaron
2mo i, 1:Burr, the Republican candidate for Vice President, had received the same
2mo i, 1:number of votes as Jefferson; as neither had a majority the election was
2mo i, 1:thrown into the House of Representatives, where the Federalists held the
2mo i, 1:balance of power. Although it was well known that Burr was not even a
2mo i, 1:candidate for President, his friends and many Federalists began
2mo i, 1:intriguing for his election to that high office. Had it not been for the
2mo i, 1:vigorous action of Hamilton the prize might have been snatched out of
2mo i, 1:Jefferson's hands. Not until the thirty-sixth ballot on February 17,
2mo i, 1:1801, was the great issue decided in his favor.[2]

2mo i, 1:CHAPTER IX
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE JEFFERSONIAN REPUBLICANS IN POWER
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Opposition to Strong Central Government.=--Cherishing especially the
2mo i, 1:agricultural interest, as Jefferson said, the Republicans were in the
2mo i, 1:beginning provincial in their concern and outlook. Their attachment to
2mo i, 1:America was, certainly, as strong as that of Hamilton; but they regarded
2mo i, 1:the state, rather than the national government, as the proper center of
2mo i, 1:power and affection. Indeed, a large part of the rank and file had been
2mo i, 1:among the opponents of the Constitution in the days of its adoption.
2mo i, 1:Jefferson had entertained doubts about it and Monroe, destined to be the
2mo i, 1:fifth President, had been one of the bitter foes of ratification. The
2mo i, 1:former went so far in the direction of local autonomy that he exalted
2mo i, 1:the state above the nation in the Kentucky resolutions of 1798,
2mo i, 1:declaring the Constitution to be a mere compact and the states competent
2mo i, 1:to interpret and nullify federal law. This was provincialism with a
2mo i, 1:vengeance. "It is jealousy, not confidence, which prescribes limited
2mo i, 1:constitutions," wrote Jefferson for the Kentucky legislature. Jealousy
2mo i, 1:of the national government, not confidence in it--this is the ideal that
2mo i, 1:reflected the provincial and agricultural interest.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Republican Simplicity.=--Every act of the Jeffersonian party during its
2mo i, 1:early days of power was in accord with the ideals of government which it
2mo i, 1:professed. It had opposed all pomp and ceremony, calculated to give
2mo i, 1:weight and dignity to the chief executive of the nation, as symbols of
2mo i, 1:monarchy and high prerogative. Appropriately, therefore, Jefferson's
2mo i, 1:inauguration on March 4, 1801, the first at the new capital at
2mo i, 1:Washington, was marked by extreme simplicity. In keeping with this
2mo i, 1:procedure he quit the practice, followed by Washington and Adams, of
2mo i, 1:reading presidential addresses to Congress in joint assembly and adopted
2mo i, 1:in its stead the plan of sending his messages in writing--a custom that
2mo i, 1:was continued unbroken until 1913 when President Wilson returned to the
2mo i, 1:example set by the first chief magistrate.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Republican Measures.=--The Republicans had complained of a great
2mo i, 1:national debt as the source of a dangerous "money power," giving
2mo i, 1:strength to the federal government; accordingly they began to pay it off
2mo i, 1:as rapidly as possible. They had held commerce in low esteem and looked
2mo i, 1:upon a large navy as a mere device to protect it; consequently they
2mo i, 1:reduced the number of warships. They had objected to excise taxes,
2mo i, 1:particularly on whisky; these they quickly abolished, to the intense
2mo i, 1:satisfaction of the farmers. They had protested against the heavy cost
2mo i, 1:of the federal government; they reduced expenses by discharging hundreds
2mo i, 1:of men from the army and abolishing many offices.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:They had savagely criticized the Sedition law and Jefferson refused to
2mo i, 1:enforce it. They had been deeply offended by the assault on freedom of
2mo i, 1:speech and press and they promptly impeached Samuel Chase, a justice of
2mo i, 1:the Supreme Court, who had been especially severe in his attacks upon
2mo i, 1:offenders under the Sedition Act. Their failure to convict Justice Chase
2mo i, 1:by a narrow margin was due to no lack of zeal on their part but to the
2mo i, 1:Federalist strength in the Senate where the trial was held. They had
2mo i, 1:regarded the appointment of a large number of federal judges during the
2mo i, 1:last hours of Adams' administration as an attempt to intrench
2mo i, 1:Federalists in the judiciary and to enlarge the sphere of the national
2mo i, 1:government. Accordingly, they at once repealed the act creating the new
2mo i, 1:judgeships, thus depriving the "midnight appointees" of their posts.
2mo i, 1:They had considered the federal offices, civil and military, as sources
2mo i, 1:of great strength to the Federalists and Jefferson, though committed to
2mo i, 1:the principle that offices should be open to all and distributed
2mo i, 1:according to merit, was careful to fill most of the vacancies as they
2mo i, 1:occurred with trusted Republicans. To his credit, however, it must be
2mo i, 1:said that he did not make wholesale removals to find room for party
2mo i, 1:workers.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The Republicans thus hewed to the line of their general policy of
2mo i, 1:restricting the weight, dignity, and activity of the national
2mo i, 1:government. Yet there were no Republicans, as the Federalists asserted,
2mo i, 1:prepared to urge serious modifications in the Constitution. "If there be
2mo i, 1:any among us who wish to dissolve this union or to change its republican
2mo i, 1:form," wrote Jefferson in his first inaugural, "let them stand
2mo i, 1:undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may
2mo i, 1:be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it." After reciting the
2mo i, 1:fortunate circumstances of climate, soil, and isolation which made the
2mo i, 1:future of America so full of promise, Jefferson concluded: "A wise and
2mo i, 1:frugal government which shall restrain men from injuring one another,
2mo i, 1:shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of
2mo i, 1:industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labour the
2mo i, 1:bread it has earned. This is the sum of good government; and this is
2mo i, 1:necessary to close the circle of our felicities."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In all this the Republicans had not reckoned with destiny. In a few
2mo i, 1:short years that lay ahead it was their fate to double the territory of
2mo i, 1:the country, making inevitable a continental nation; to give the
2mo i, 1:Constitution a generous interpretation that shocked many a Federalist;
2mo i, 1:to wage war on behalf of American commerce; to reestablish the hated
2mo i, 1:United States Bank; to enact a high protective tariff; to see their
2mo i, 1:Federalist opponents in their turn discredited as nullifiers and
2mo i, 1:provincials; to announce high national doctrines in foreign affairs; and
2mo i, 1:to behold the Constitution exalted and defended against the pretensions
2mo i, 1:of states by a son of old Virginia, John Marshall, Chief Justice of the
2mo i, 1:Supreme Court of the United States.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE REPUBLICANS AND THE GREAT WEST
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Expansion and Land Hunger.=--The first of the great measures which
2mo i, 1:drove the Republicans out upon this new national course--the purchase
2mo i, 1:of the Louisiana territory--was the product of circumstances rather than
2mo i, 1:of their deliberate choosing. It was not the lack of land for his
2mo i, 1:cherished farmers that led Jefferson to add such an immense domain to
2mo i, 1:the original possessions of the United States. In the Northwest
2mo i, 1:territory, now embracing Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin,
2mo i, 1:and a portion of Minnesota, settlements were mainly confined to the
2mo i, 1:north bank of the Ohio River. To the south, in Kentucky and Tennessee,
2mo i, 1:where there were more than one hundred thousand white people who had
2mo i, 1:pushed over the mountains from Virginia and the Carolinas, there were
2mo i, 1:still wide reaches of untilled soil. The Alabama and Mississippi regions
2mo i, 1:were vast Indian frontiers of the state of Georgia, unsettled and almost
2mo i, 1:unexplored. Even to the wildest imagination there seemed to be territory
2mo i, 1:enough to satisfy the land hunger of the American people for a century
2mo i, 1:to come.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Significance of the Mississippi River.=--At all events the East,
2mo i, 1:then the center of power, saw no good reason for expansion. The planters
2mo i, 1:of the Carolinas, the manufacturers of Pennsylvania, the importers of
2mo i, 1:New York, the shipbuilders of New England, looking to the seaboard and
2mo i, 1:to Europe for trade, refinements, and sometimes their ideas of
2mo i, 1:government, were slow to appreciate the place of the West in national
2mo i, 1:economy. The better educated the Easterners were, the less, it seems,
2mo i, 1:they comprehended the destiny of the nation. Sons of Federalist fathers
2mo i, 1:at Williams College, after a long debate decided by a vote of fifteen to
2mo i, 1:one that the purchase of Louisiana was undesirable.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:On the other hand, the pioneers of Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee,
2mo i, 1:unlearned in books, saw with their own eyes the resources of the
2mo i, 1:wilderness. Many of them had been across the Mississippi and had beheld
2mo i, 1:the rich lands awaiting the plow of the white man. Down the great river
2mo i, 1:they floated their wheat, corn, and bacon to ocean-going ships bound for
2mo i, 1:the ports of the seaboard or for Europe. The land journeys over the
2mo i, 1:mountain barriers with bulky farm produce, they knew from experience,
2mo i, 1:were almost impossible, and costly at best. Nails, bolts of cloth, tea,
2mo i, 1:and coffee could go or come that way, but not corn and bacon. A free
2mo i, 1:outlet to the sea by the Mississippi was as essential to the pioneers of
2mo i, 1:the Kentucky region as the harbor of Boston to the merchant princes of
2mo i, 1:that metropolis.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Louisiana under Spanish Rule.=--For this reason they watched with deep
2mo i, 1:solicitude the fortunes of the Spanish king to whom, at the close of the
2mo i, 1:Seven Years' War, had fallen the Louisiana territory stretching from New
2mo i, 1:Orleans to the Rocky Mountains. While he controlled the mouth of the
2mo i, 1:Mississippi there was little to fear, for he had neither the army nor
2mo i, 1:the navy necessary to resist any invasion of American trade. Moreover,
2mo i, 1:Washington had been able, by the exercise of great tact, to secure from
2mo i, 1:Spain in 1795 a trading privilege through New Orleans which satisfied
2mo i, 1:the present requirements of the frontiersmen even if it did not allay
2mo i, 1:their fears for the future. So things stood when a swift succession of
2mo i, 1:events altered the whole situation.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Louisiana Transferred to France.=--In July, 1802, a royal order from
2mo i, 1:Spain instructed the officials at New Orleans to close the port to
2mo i, 1:American produce. About the same time a disturbing rumor, long current,
2mo i, 1:was confirmed--Napoleon had coerced Spain into returning Louisiana to
2mo i, 1:France by a secret treaty signed in 1800. "The scalers of the Alps and
2mo i, 1:conquerors of Venice" now looked across the sea for new scenes of
2mo i, 1:adventure. The West was ablaze with excitement. A call for war ran
2mo i, 1:through the frontier; expeditions were organized to prevent the landing
2mo i, 1:of the French; and petitions for instant action flooded in upon
2mo i, 1:Jefferson.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Jefferson Sees the Danger.=--Jefferson, the friend of France and sworn
2mo i, 1:enemy of England, compelled to choose in the interest of America, never
2mo i, 1:winced. "The cession of Louisiana and the Floridas by Spain to France,"
2mo i, 1:he wrote to Livingston, the American minister in Paris, "works sorely on
2mo i, 1:the United States. It completely reverses all the political relations of
2mo i, 1:the United States and will form a new epoch in our political course....
2mo i, 1:There is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is our
2mo i, 1:natural and habitual enemy. It is New Orleans through which the produce
2mo i, 1:of three-eighths of our territory must pass to market.... France,
2mo i, 1:placing herself in that door, assumes to us an attitude of defiance.
2mo i, 1:Spain might have retained it quietly for years. Her pacific
2mo i, 1:dispositions, her feeble state would induce her to increase our
2mo i, 1:facilities there.... Not so can it ever be in the hands of France....
2mo i, 1:The day that France takes possession of New Orleans fixes the sentence
2mo i, 1:which is to restrain her forever within her low water mark.... It seals
2mo i, 1:the union of the two nations who in conjunction can maintain exclusive
2mo i, 1:possession of the ocean. From that moment we must marry ourselves to the
2mo i, 1:British fleet and nation.... This is not a state of things we seek or
2mo i, 1:desire. It is one which this measure, if adopted by France, forces on us
2mo i, 1:as necessarily as any other cause by the laws of nature brings on its
2mo i, 1:necessary effect."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Louisiana Purchased.=--Acting on this belief, but apparently seeing
2mo i, 1:only the Mississippi outlet at stake, Jefferson sent his friend, James
2mo i, 1:Monroe, to France with the power to buy New Orleans and West Florida.
2mo i, 1:Before Monroe arrived, the regular minister, Livingston, had already
2mo i, 1:convinced Napoleon that it would be well to sell territory which might
2mo i, 1:be wrested from him at any moment by the British sea power, especially
2mo i, 1:as the war, temporarily stopped by the peace of Amiens, was once more
2mo i, 1:raging in Europe. Wise as he was in his day, Livingston had at first no
2mo i, 1:thought of buying the whole Louisiana country. He was simply dazed when
2mo i, 1:Napoleon offered to sell the entire domain and get rid of the business
2mo i, 1:altogether. Though staggered by the proposal, he and Monroe decided to
2mo i, 1:accept. On April 30, they signed the treaty of cession, agreeing to pay
2mo i, 1:$11,250,000 in six per cent bonds and to discharge certain debts due
2mo i, 1:French citizens, making in all approximately fifteen millions. Spain
2mo i, 1:protested, Napoleon's brother fumed, French newspapers objected; but the
2mo i, 1:deed was done.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Jefferson and His Constitutional Scruples.=--When the news of this
2mo i, 1:extraordinary event reached the United States, the people were filled
2mo i, 1:with astonishment, and no one was more surprised than Jefferson himself.
2mo i, 1:He had thought of buying New Orleans and West Florida for a small sum,
2mo i, 1:and now a vast domain had been dumped into the lap of the nation. He was
2mo i, 1:puzzled. On looking into the Constitution he found not a line
2mo i, 1:authorizing the purchase of more territory and so he drafted an
2mo i, 1:amendment declaring "Louisiana, as ceded by France,--a part of the
2mo i, 1:United States." He had belabored the Federalists for piling up a big
2mo i, 1:national debt and he could hardly endure the thought of issuing more
2mo i, 1:bonds himself.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In the midst of his doubts came the news that Napoleon might withdraw
2mo i, 1:from the bargain. Thoroughly alarmed by that, Jefferson pressed the
2mo i, 1:Senate for a ratification of the treaty. He still clung to his original
2mo i, 1:idea that the Constitution did not warrant the purchase; but he lamely
2mo i, 1:concluded: "If our friends shall think differently, I shall certainly
2mo i, 1:acquiesce with satisfaction; confident that the good sense of our
2mo i, 1:country will correct the evil of construction when it shall produce ill
2mo i, 1:effects." Thus the stanch advocate of "strict interpretation" cut loose
2mo i, 1:from his own doctrine and intrusted the construction of the Constitution
2mo i, 1:to "the good sense" of his countrymen.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Treaty Ratified.=--This unusual transaction, so favorable to the
2mo i, 1:West, aroused the ire of the seaboard Federalists. Some denounced it as
2mo i, 1:unconstitutional, easily forgetting Hamilton's masterly defense of the
2mo i, 1:bank, also not mentioned in the Constitution. Others urged that, if "the
2mo i, 1:howling wilderness" ever should be settled, it would turn against the
2mo i, 1:East, form new commercial connections, and escape from federal control.
2mo i, 1:Still others protested that the purchase would lead inevitably to the
2mo i, 1:dominance of a "hotch potch of wild men from the Far West." Federalists,
2mo i, 1:who thought "the broad back of America" could readily bear Hamilton's
2mo i, 1:consolidated debt, now went into agonies over a bond issue of less than
2mo i, 1:one-sixth of that amount. But in vain. Jefferson's party with a high
2mo i, 1:hand carried the day. The Senate, after hearing the Federalist protest,
2mo i, 1:ratified the treaty. In December, 1803, the French flag was hauled down
2mo i, 1:from the old government buildings in New Orleans and the Stars and
2mo i, 1:Stripes were hoisted as a sign that the land of Coronado, De Soto,
2mo i, 1:Marquette, and La Salle had passed forever to the United States.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES IN 1805]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:By a single stroke, the original territory of the United States was more
2mo i, 1:than doubled. While the boundaries of the purchase were uncertain, it is
2mo i, 1:safe to say that the Louisiana territory included what is now Arkansas,
2mo i, 1:Missouri, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, and large
2mo i, 1:portions of Louisiana, Minnesota, North Dakota, Colorado, Montana, and
2mo i, 1:Wyoming. The farm lands that the friends of "a little America" on the
2mo i, 1:seacoast declared a hopeless wilderness were, within a hundred years,
2mo i, 1:fully occupied and valued at nearly seven billion dollars--almost five
2mo i, 1:hundred times the price paid to Napoleon.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Western Explorations.=--Having taken the fateful step, Jefferson wisely
2mo i, 1:began to make the most of it. He prepared for the opening of the new
2mo i, 1:country by sending the Lewis and Clark expedition to explore it,
2mo i, 1:discover its resources, and lay out an overland route through the
2mo i, 1:Missouri Valley and across the Great Divide to the Pacific. The story of
2mo i, 1:this mighty exploit, which began in the spring of 1804 and ended in the
2mo i, 1:autumn of 1806, was set down with skill and pains in the journal of
2mo i, 1:Lewis and Clark; when published even in a short form, it invited the
2mo i, 1:forward-looking men of the East to take thought about the western
2mo i, 1:empire. At the same time Zebulon Pike, in a series of journeys, explored
2mo i, 1:the sources of the Mississippi River and penetrated the Spanish
2mo i, 1:territories of the far Southwest. Thus scouts and pioneers continued the
2mo i, 1:work of diplomats.

2mo i, 1:THE REPUBLICAN WAR FOR COMMERCIAL INDEPENDENCE
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The English and French Blockades.=--In addition to bringing Louisiana
2mo i, 1:to the United States, the reopening of the European War in 1803, after a
2mo i, 1:short lull, renewed in an acute form the commercial difficulties that
2mo i, 1:had plagued the country all during the administrations of Washington and
2mo i, 1:Adams. The Republicans were now plunged into the hornets' nest. The
2mo i, 1:party whose ardent spirits had burned Jay in effigy, stoned Hamilton for
2mo i, 1:defending his treaty, jeered Washington's proclamation of neutrality,
2mo i, 1:and spoken bitterly of "timid traders," could no longer take refuge in
2mo i, 1:criticism. It had to act.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Its troubles took a serious turn in 1806. England, in a determined
2mo i, 1:effort to bring France to her knees by starvation, declared the coast of
2mo i, 1:Europe blockaded from Brest to the mouth of the Elbe River. Napoleon
2mo i, 1:retaliated by his Berlin Decree of November, 1806, blockading the
2mo i, 1:British Isles--a measure terrifying to American ship owners whose
2mo i, 1:vessels were liable to seizure by any French rover, though Napoleon had
2mo i, 1:no navy to make good his proclamation. Great Britain countered with a
2mo i, 1:still more irritating decree--the Orders in Council of 1807. It modified
2mo i, 1:its blockade, but in so doing merely authorized American ships not
2mo i, 1:carrying munitions of war to complete their voyage to the Continent, on
2mo i, 1:condition of their stopping at a British port, securing a license, and
2mo i, 1:paying a tax. This, responded Napoleon, was the height of insolence, and
2mo i, 1:he denounced it as a gross violation of international law. He then
2mo i, 1:closed the circle of American troubles by issuing his Milan Decree of
2mo i, 1:December, 1807. This order declared that any ship which complied with
2mo i, 1:the British rules would be subject to seizure and confiscation by French
2mo i, 1:authorities.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Impressment of Seamen.=--That was not all. Great Britain, in dire
2mo i, 1:need of men for her navy, adopted the practice of stopping American
2mo i, 1:ships, searching them, and carrying away British-born sailors found on
2mo i, 1:board. British sailors were so badly treated, so cruelly flogged for
2mo i, 1:trivial causes, and so meanly fed that they fled in crowds to the
2mo i, 1:American marine. In many cases it was difficult to tell whether seamen
2mo i, 1:were English or American. They spoke the same language, so that language
2mo i, 1:was no test. Rovers on the deep and stragglers in the ports of both
2mo i, 1:countries, they frequently had no papers to show their nativity.
2mo i, 1:Moreover, Great Britain held to the old rule--"Once an Englishman,
2mo i, 1:always an Englishman"--a doctrine rejected by the United States in
2mo i, 1:favor of the principle that a man could choose the nation to which he
2mo i, 1:would give allegiance. British sea captains, sometimes by mistake, and
2mo i, 1:often enough with reckless indifference, carried away into servitude in
2mo i, 1:their own navy genuine American citizens. The process itself, even when
2mo i, 1:executed with all the civilities of law, was painful enough, for it
2mo i, 1:meant that American ships were forced to "come to," and compelled to
2mo i, 1:rest submissively under British guns until the searching party had pried
2mo i, 1:into records, questioned seamen, seized and handcuffed victims. Saints
2mo i, 1:could not have done this work without raising angry passions, and only
2mo i, 1:saints could have endured it with patience and fortitude.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Had the enactment of the scenes been confined to the high seas and
2mo i, 1:knowledge of them to rumors and newspaper stories, American resentment
2mo i, 1:might not have been so intense; but many a search and seizure was made
2mo i, 1:in sight of land. British and French vessels patrolled the coasts,
2mo i, 1:firing on one another and chasing one another in American waters within
2mo i, 1:the three-mile limit. When, in the summer of 1807, the American frigate
2mo i, 1:_Chesapeake_ refused to surrender men alleged to be deserters from King
2mo i, 1:George's navy, the British warship _Leopard_ opened fire, killing three
2mo i, 1:men and wounding eighteen more--an act which even the British ministry
2mo i, 1:could hardly excuse. If the French were less frequently the offenders,
2mo i, 1:it was not because of their tenderness about American rights but because
2mo i, 1:so few of their ships escaped the hawk-eyed British navy to operate in
2mo i, 1:American waters.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Losses in American Commerce.=--This high-handed conduct on the part
2mo i, 1:of European belligerents was very injurious to American trade. By their
2mo i, 1:enterprise, American shippers had become the foremost carriers on the
2mo i, 1:Atlantic Ocean. In a decade they had doubled the tonnage of American
2mo i, 1:merchant ships under the American flag, taking the place of the French
2mo i, 1:marine when Britain swept that from the seas, and supplying Britain with
2mo i, 1:the sinews of war for the contest with the Napoleonic empire. The
2mo i, 1:American shipping engaged in foreign trade embraced 363,110 tons in
2mo i, 1:1791; 669,921 tons in 1800; and almost 1,000,000 tons in 1810. Such was
2mo i, 1:the enterprise attacked by the British and French decrees. American
2mo i, 1:ships bound for Great Britain were liable to be captured by French
2mo i, 1:privateers which, in spite of the disasters of the Nile and Trafalgar,
2mo i, 1:ranged the seas. American ships destined for the Continent, if they
2mo i, 1:failed to stop at British ports and pay tribute, were in great danger of
2mo i, 1:capture by the sleepless British navy and its swarm of auxiliaries.
2mo i, 1:American sea captains who, in fear of British vengeance, heeded the
2mo i, 1:Orders in Council and paid the tax were almost certain to fall a prey to
2mo i, 1:French vengeance, for the French were vigorous in executing the Milan
2mo i, 1:Decree.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Jefferson's Policy.=--The President's dilemma was distressing. Both the
2mo i, 1:belligerents in Europe were guilty of depredations on American commerce.
2mo i, 1:War on both of them was out of the question. War on France was
2mo i, 1:impossible because she had no territory on this side of the water which
2mo i, 1:could be reached by American troops and her naval forces had been
2mo i, 1:shattered at the battles of the Nile and Trafalgar. War on Great
2mo i, 1:Britain, a power which Jefferson's followers feared and distrusted, was
2mo i, 1:possible but not inviting. Jefferson shrank from it. A man of peace, he
2mo i, 1:disliked war's brazen clamor; a man of kindly spirit, he was startled at
2mo i, 1:the death and destruction which it brought in its train. So for the
2mo i, 1:eight years Jefferson steered an even course, suggesting measure after
2mo i, 1:measure with a view to avoiding bloodshed. He sent, it is true,
2mo i, 1:Commodore Preble in 1803 to punish Mediterranean pirates preying upon
2mo i, 1:American commerce; but a great war he evaded with passionate
2mo i, 1:earnestness, trying in its place every other expedient to protect
2mo i, 1:American rights.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Embargo and Non-intercourse Acts.=--In 1806, Congress passed and
2mo i, 1:Jefferson approved a non-importation act closing American ports to
2mo i, 1:certain products from British dominions--a measure intended as a club
2mo i, 1:over the British government's head. This law, failing in its purpose,
2mo i, 1:Jefferson proposed and Congress adopted in December, 1807, the Embargo
2mo i, 1:Act forbidding all vessels to leave American harbors for foreign ports.
2mo i, 1:France and England were to be brought to terms by cutting off their
2mo i, 1:supplies.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The result of the embargo was pathetic. England and France refused to
2mo i, 1:give up search and seizure. American ship owners who, lured by huge
2mo i, 1:profits, had formerly been willing to take the risk were now restrained
2mo i, 1:by law to their home ports. Every section suffered. The South and West
2mo i, 1:found their markets for cotton, rice, tobacco, corn, and bacon
2mo i, 1:curtailed. Thus they learned by bitter experience the national
2mo i, 1:significance of commerce. Ship masters, ship builders, longshoremen, and
2mo i, 1:sailors were thrown out of employment while the prices of foreign goods
2mo i, 1:doubled. Those who obeyed the law were ruined; violators of the law
2mo i, 1:smuggled goods into Canada and Florida for shipment abroad.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Jefferson's friends accepted the medicine with a wry face as the only
2mo i, 1:alternative to supine submission or open war. His opponents, without
2mo i, 1:offering any solution of their own, denounced it as a contemptible plan
2mo i, 1:that brought neither relief nor honor. Beset by the clamor that arose on
2mo i, 1:all sides, Congress, in the closing days of Jefferson's administration,
2mo i, 1:repealed the Embargo law and substituted a Non-intercourse act
2mo i, 1:forbidding trade with England and France while permitting it with other
2mo i, 1:countries--a measure equally futile in staying the depredations on
2mo i, 1:American shipping.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Jefferson Retires in Favor of Madison.=--Jefferson, exhausted by
2mo i, 1:endless wrangling and wounded, as Washington had been, by savage
2mo i, 1:criticism, welcomed March 4, 1809. His friends urged him to "stay by the
2mo i, 1:ship" and accept a third term. He declined, saying that election for
2mo i, 1:life might result from repeated reelection. In following Washington's
2mo i, 1:course and defending it on principle, he set an example to all his
2mo i, 1:successors, making the "third term doctrine" a part of American
2mo i, 1:unwritten law.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:His intimate friend, James Madison, to whom he turned over the burdens
2mo i, 1:of his high office was, like himself, a man of peace. Madison had been a
2mo i, 1:leader since the days of the Revolution, but in legislative halls and
2mo i, 1:council chambers, not on the field of battle. Small in stature,
2mo i, 1:sensitive in feelings, studious in habits, he was no man for the rough
2mo i, 1:and tumble of practical politics. He had taken a prominent and
2mo i, 1:distinguished part in the framing and the adoption of the Constitution.
2mo i, 1:He had served in the first Congress as a friend of Hamilton's measures.
2mo i, 1:Later he attached himself to Jefferson's fortunes and served for eight
2mo i, 1:years as his first counselor, the Secretary of State. The principles of
2mo i, 1:the Constitution, which he had helped to make and interpret, he was now
2mo i, 1:as President called upon to apply in one of the most perplexing moments
2mo i, 1:in all American history. In keeping with his own traditions and
2mo i, 1:following in the footsteps of Jefferson, he vainly tried to solve the
2mo i, 1:foreign problem by negotiation.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Trend of Events.=--Whatever difficulties Madison had in making up
2mo i, 1:his mind on war and peace were settled by events beyond his own control.
2mo i, 1:In the spring of 1811, a British frigate held up an American ship near
2mo i, 1:the harbor of New York and impressed a seaman alleged to be an American
2mo i, 1:citizen. Burning with resentment, the captain of the _President_, an
2mo i, 1:American warship, acting under orders, poured several broadsides into
2mo i, 1:the _Little Belt_, a British sloop, suspected of being the guilty party.
2mo i, 1:The British also encouraged the Indian chief Tecumseh, who welded
2mo i, 1:together the Indians of the Northwest under British protection and gave
2mo i, 1:signs of restlessness presaging a revolt. This sent a note of alarm
2mo i, 1:along the frontier that was not checked even when, in November,
2mo i, 1:Tecumseh's men were badly beaten at Tippecanoe by William Henry
2mo i, 1:Harrison. The Indians stood in the way of the advancing frontier, and it
2mo i, 1:seemed to the pioneers that, without support from the British in Canada,
2mo i, 1:the Red Men would soon be subdued.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Clay and Calhoun.=--While events were moving swiftly and rumors were
2mo i, 1:flying thick and fast, the mastery of the government passed from the
2mo i, 1:uncertain hands of Madison to a party of ardent young men in Congress,
2mo i, 1:dubbed "Young Republicans," under the leadership of two members destined
2mo i, 1:to be mighty figures in American history: Henry Clay of Kentucky and
2mo i, 1:John C. Calhoun of South Carolina. The former contended, in a flair of
2mo i, 1:folly, that "the militia of Kentucky alone are competent to place
2mo i, 1:Montreal and Upper Canada at your feet." The latter with a light heart
2mo i, 1:spoke of conquering Canada in a four weeks' campaign. "It must not be
2mo i, 1:inferred," says Channing, "that in advocating conquest, the Westerners
2mo i, 1:were actuated merely by desire for land; they welcomed war because they
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:thought it would be the easiest way to abate Indian troubles. The
2mo i, 1:savages were supported by the fur-trading interests that centred at
2mo i, 1:Quebec and London.... The Southerners on their part wished for Florida
2mo i, 1:and they thought that the conquest of Canada would obviate some Northern
2mo i, 1:opposition to this acquisition of slave territory." While Clay and
2mo i, 1:Calhoun, spokesmen of the West and South, were not unmindful of what
2mo i, 1:Napoleon had done to American commerce, they knew that their followers
2mo i, 1:still remembered with deep gratitude the aid of the French in the war
2mo i, 1:for independence and that the embers of the old hatred for George III,
2mo i, 1:still on the throne, could be readily blown into flame.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Madison Accepts War as Inevitable.=--The conduct of the British
2mo i, 1:ministers with whom Madison had to deal did little to encourage him in
2mo i, 1:adhering to the policy of "watchful waiting." One of them, a high Tory,
2mo i, 1:believed that all Americans were alike "except that a few are less
2mo i, 1:knaves than others" and his methods were colored by his belief. On the
2mo i, 1:recall of this minister the British government selected another no less
2mo i, 1:high and mighty in his principles and opinions. So Madison became
2mo i, 1:thoroughly discouraged about the outcome of pacific measures. When the
2mo i, 1:pressure from Congress upon him became too heavy, he gave way, signing
2mo i, 1:on June 18, 1812, the declaration of war on Great Britain. In
2mo i, 1:proclaiming hostilities, the administration set forth the causes which
2mo i, 1:justified the declaration; namely, the British had been encouraging the
2mo i, 1:Indians to attack American citizens on the frontier; they had ruined
2mo i, 1:American trade by blockades; they had insulted the American flag by
2mo i, 1:stopping and searching our ships; they had illegally seized American
2mo i, 1:sailors and driven them into the British navy.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Course of the War.=--The war lasted for nearly three years without
2mo i, 1:bringing victory to either side. The surrender of Detroit by General
2mo i, 1:Hull to the British and the failure of the American invasion of Canada
2mo i, 1:were offset by Perry's victory on Lake Erie and a decisive blow
2mo i, 1:administered to British designs for an invasion of New York by way of
2mo i, 1:Plattsburgh. The triumph of Jackson at New Orleans helped to atone for
2mo i, 1:the humiliation suffered in the burning of the Capitol by the British.
2mo i, 1:The stirring deeds of the _Constitution_, the _United States_, and the
2mo i, 1:_Argus_ on the seas, the heroic death of Lawrence and the victories of a
2mo i, 1:hundred privateers furnished consolation for those who suffered from the
2mo i, 1:iron blockade finally established by the British government when it came
2mo i, 1:to appreciate the gravity of the situation. While men love the annals of
2mo i, 1:the sea, they will turn to the running battles, the narrow escapes, and
2mo i, 1:the reckless daring of American sailors in that naval contest with Great
2mo i, 1:Britain.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:All this was exciting but it was inconclusive. In fact, never was a
2mo i, 1:government less prepared than was that of the United States in 1812. It
2mo i, 1:had neither the disciplined troops, the ships of war, nor the supplies
2mo i, 1:required by the magnitude of the military task. It was fortune that
2mo i, 1:favored the American cause. Great Britain, harassed, worn, and
2mo i, 1:financially embarrassed by nearly twenty years of fighting in Europe,
2mo i, 1:was in no mood to gather her forces for a titanic effort in America even
2mo i, 1:after Napoleon was overthrown and sent into exile at Elba in the spring
2mo i, 1:of 1814. War clouds still hung on the European horizon and the conflict
2mo i, 1:temporarily halted did again break out. To be rid of American anxieties
2mo i, 1:and free for European eventualities, England was ready to settle with
2mo i, 1:the United States, especially as that could be done without conceding
2mo i, 1:anything or surrendering any claims.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Treaty of Peace.=--Both countries were in truth sick of a war that
2mo i, 1:offered neither glory nor profit. Having indulged in the usual
2mo i, 1:diplomatic skirmishing, they sent representatives to Ghent to discuss
2mo i, 1:terms of peace. After long negotiations an agreement was reached on
2mo i, 1:Christmas eve, 1814, a few days before Jackson's victory at New Orleans.
2mo i, 1:When the treaty reached America the people were surprised to find that
2mo i, 1:it said nothing about the seizure of American sailors, the destruction
2mo i, 1:of American trade, the searching of American ships, or the support of
2mo i, 1:Indians on the frontier. Nevertheless, we are told, the people "passed
2mo i, 1:from gloom to glory" when the news of peace arrived. The bells were
2mo i, 1:rung; schools were closed; flags were displayed; and many a rousing
2mo i, 1:toast was drunk in tavern and private home. The rejoicing could
2mo i, 1:continue. With Napoleon definitely beaten at Waterloo in June, 1815,
2mo i, 1:Great Britain had no need to impress sailors, search ships, and
2mo i, 1:confiscate American goods bound to the Continent. Once more the terrible
2mo i, 1:sea power sank into the background and the ocean was again white with
2mo i, 1:the sails of merchantmen.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE REPUBLICANS NATIONALIZED
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Federalists Discredited.=--By a strange turn of fortune's wheel,
2mo i, 1:the party of Hamilton, Washington, Adams, the party of the grand nation,
2mo i, 1:became the party of provincialism and nullification. New England,
2mo i, 1:finding its shipping interests crippled in the European conflict and
2mo i, 1:then penalized by embargoes, opposed the declaration of war on Great
2mo i, 1:Britain, which meant the completion of the ruin already begun. In the
2mo i, 1:course of the struggle, the Federalist leaders came perilously near to
2mo i, 1:treason in their efforts to hamper the government of the United States;
2mo i, 1:and in their desperation they fell back upon the doctrine of
2mo i, 1:nullification so recently condemned by them when it came from Kentucky.
2mo i, 1:The Senate of Massachusetts, while the war was in progress, resolved
2mo i, 1:that it was waged "without justifiable cause," and refused to approve
2mo i, 1:military and naval projects not connected with "the defense of our
2mo i, 1:seacoast and soil." A Boston newspaper declared that the union was
2mo i, 1:nothing but a treaty among sovereign states, that states could decide
2mo i, 1:for themselves the question of obeying federal law, and that armed
2mo i, 1:resistance under the banner of a state would not be rebellion or
2mo i, 1:treason. The general assembly of Connecticut reminded the administration
2mo i, 1:at Washington that "the state of Connecticut is a free, sovereign, and
2mo i, 1:independent state." Gouverneur Morris, a member of the convention which
2mo i, 1:had drafted the Constitution, suggested the holding of another
2mo i, 1:conference to consider whether the Northern states should remain in the
2mo i, 1:union.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: _From an old cartoon_
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:NEW ENGLAND JUMPING INTO THE HANDS OF GEORGE III]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In October, 1814, a convention of delegates from Connecticut,
2mo i, 1:Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and certain counties of New Hampshire and
2mo i, 1:Vermont was held at Hartford, on the call of Massachusetts. The counsels
2mo i, 1:of the extremists were rejected but the convention solemnly went on
2mo i, 1:record to the effect that acts of Congress in violation of the
2mo i, 1:Constitution are void; that in cases of deliberate, dangerous, and
2mo i, 1:palpable infractions the state is duty bound to interpose its authority
2mo i, 1:for the protection of its citizens; and that when emergencies occur the
2mo i, 1:states must be their own judges and execute their own decisions. Thus
2mo i, 1:New England answered the challenge of Calhoun and Clay. Fortunately its
2mo i, 1:actions were not as rash as its words. The Hartford convention merely
2mo i, 1:proposed certain amendments to the Constitution and adjourned. At the
2mo i, 1:close of the war, its proposals vanished harmlessly; but the men who
2mo i, 1:made them were hopelessly discredited.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Second United States Bank.=--In driving the Federalists towards
2mo i, 1:nullification and waging a national war themselves, the Republicans lost
2mo i, 1:all their old taint of provincialism. Moreover, in turning to measures
2mo i, 1:of reconstruction called forth by the war, they resorted to the national
2mo i, 1:devices of the Federalists. In 1816, they chartered for a period of
2mo i, 1:twenty years a second United States Bank--the institution which
2mo i, 1:Jefferson and Madison once had condemned as unsound and
2mo i, 1:unconstitutional. The Constitution remained unchanged; times and
2mo i, 1:circumstances had changed. Calhoun dismissed the vexed question of
2mo i, 1:constitutionality with a scant reference to an ancient dispute, while
2mo i, 1:Madison set aside his scruples and signed the bill.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Protective Tariff of 1816.=--The Republicans supplemented the Bank
2mo i, 1:by another Federalist measure--a high protective tariff. Clay viewed it
2mo i, 1:as the beginning of his "American system" of protection. Calhoun
2mo i, 1:defended it on national principles. For this sudden reversal of policy
2mo i, 1:the young Republicans were taunted by some of their older party
2mo i, 1:colleagues with betraying the "agricultural interest" that Jefferson had
2mo i, 1:fostered; but Calhoun refused to listen to their criticisms. "When the
2mo i, 1:seas are open," he said, "the produce of the South may pour anywhere
2mo i, 1:into the markets of the Old World.... What are the effects of a war with
2mo i, 1:a maritime power--with England? Our commerce annihilated ... our
2mo i, 1:agriculture cut off from its accustomed markets, the surplus of the
2mo i, 1:farmer perishes on his hands.... The recent war fell with peculiar
2mo i, 1:pressure on the growers of cotton and tobacco and the other great
2mo i, 1:staples of the country; and the same state of things will recur in the
2mo i, 1:event of another war unless prevented by the foresight of this body....
2mo i, 1:When our manufactures are grown to a certain perfection, as they soon
2mo i, 1:will be under the fostering care of the government, we shall no longer
2mo i, 1:experience these evils." With the Republicans nationalized, the
2mo i, 1:Federalist party, as an organization, disappeared after a crushing
2mo i, 1:defeat in the presidential campaign of 1816.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Monroe and the Florida Purchase.=--To the victor in that political
2mo i, 1:contest, James Monroe of Virginia, fell two tasks of national
2mo i, 1:importance, adding to the prestige of the whole country and deepening
2mo i, 1:the sense of patriotism that weaned men away from mere allegiance to
2mo i, 1:states. The first of these was the purchase of Florida from Spain. The
2mo i, 1:acquisition of Louisiana let the Mississippi flow "unvexed to the sea";
2mo i, 1:but it left all the states east of the river cut off from the Gulf,
2mo i, 1:affording them ground for discontent akin to that which had moved the
2mo i, 1:pioneers of Kentucky to action a generation earlier. The uncertainty as
2mo i, 1:to the boundaries of Louisiana gave the United States a claim to West
2mo i, 1:Florida, setting on foot a movement for occupation. The Florida swamps
2mo i, 1:were a basis for Indian marauders who periodically swept into the
2mo i, 1:frontier settlements, and hiding places for runaway slaves. Thus the
2mo i, 1:sanction of international law was given to punitive expeditions into
2mo i, 1:alien territory.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The pioneer leaders stood waiting for the signal. It came. President
2mo i, 1:Monroe, on the occasion of an Indian outbreak, ordered General Jackson
2mo i, 1:to seize the offenders, in the Floridas, if necessary. The high-spirited
2mo i, 1:warrior, taking this as a hint that he was to occupy the coveted region,
2mo i, 1:replied that, if possession was the object of the invasion, he could
2mo i, 1:occupy the Floridas within sixty days. Without waiting for an answer to
2mo i, 1:this letter, he launched his expedition, and in the spring of 1818 was
2mo i, 1:master of the Spanish king's domain to the south.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:There was nothing for the king to do but to make the best of the
2mo i, 1:inevitable by ceding the Floridas to the United States in return for
2mo i, 1:five million dollars to be paid to American citizens having claims
2mo i, 1:against Spain. On Washington's birthday, 1819, the treaty was signed. It
2mo i, 1:ceded the Floridas to the United States and defined the boundary between
2mo i, 1:Mexico and the United States by drawing a line from the mouth of the
2mo i, 1:Sabine River in a northwesterly direction to the Pacific. On this
2mo i, 1:occasion even Monroe, former opponent of the Constitution, forgot to
2mo i, 1:inquire whether new territory could be constitutionally acquired and
2mo i, 1:incorporated into the American union. The Republicans seemed far away
2mo i, 1:from the days of "strict construction." And Jefferson still lived!
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Monroe Doctrine.=--Even more effective in fashioning the national
2mo i, 1:idea was Monroe's enunciation of the famous doctrine that bears his
2mo i, 1:name. The occasion was another European crisis. During the Napoleonic
2mo i, 1:upheaval and the years of dissolution that ensued, the Spanish colonies
2mo i, 1:in America, following the example set by their English neighbors in
2mo i, 1:1776, declared their independence. Unable to conquer them alone, the
2mo i, 1:king of Spain turned for help to the friendly powers of Europe that
2mo i, 1:looked upon revolution and republics with undisguised horror.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_The Holy Alliance._--He found them prepared to view his case with
2mo i, 1:sympathy. Three of them, Austria, Prussia, and Russia, under the
2mo i, 1:leadership of the Czar, Alexander I, in the autumn of 1815, had entered
2mo i, 1:into a Holy Alliance to sustain by reciprocal service the autocratic
2mo i, 1:principle in government. Although the effusive, almost maudlin, language
2mo i, 1:of the treaty did not express their purpose explicitly, the Alliance was
2mo i, 1:later regarded as a mere union of monarchs to prevent the rise and
2mo i, 1:growth of popular government.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The American people thought their worst fears confirmed when, in 1822, a
2mo i, 1:conference of delegates from Russia, Austria, Prussia, and France met at
2mo i, 1:Verona to consider, among other things, revolutions that had just broken
2mo i, 1:out in Spain and Italy. The spirit of the conference is reflected in the
2mo i, 1:first article of the agreement reached by the delegates: "The high
2mo i, 1:contracting powers, being convinced that the system of representative
2mo i, 1:government is equally incompatible with the monarchical principle and
2mo i, 1:the maxim of the sovereignty of the people with the divine right,
2mo i, 1:mutually engage in the most solemn manner to use all their efforts to
2mo i, 1:put an end to the system of representative government in whatever
2mo i, 1:country it may exist in Europe and to prevent its being introduced in
2mo i, 1:those countries where it is not yet known." The Czar, who incidentally
2mo i, 1:coveted the west coast of North America, proposed to send an army to aid
2mo i, 1:the king of Spain in his troubles at home, thus preparing the way for
2mo i, 1:intervention in Spanish America. It was material weakness not want of
2mo i, 1:spirit, that prevented the grand union of monarchs from making open war
2mo i, 1:on popular government.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_The Position of England._--Unfortunately, too, for the Holy Alliance,
2mo i, 1:England refused to cooperate. English merchants had built up a large
2mo i, 1:trade with the independent Latin-American colonies and they protested
2mo i, 1:against the restoration of Spanish sovereignty, which meant a renewal of
2mo i, 1:Spain's former trade monopoly. Moreover, divine right doctrines had been
2mo i, 1:laid to rest in England and the representative principle thoroughly
2mo i, 1:established. Already there were signs of the coming democratic flood
2mo i, 1:which was soon to carry the first reform bill of 1832, extending the
2mo i, 1:suffrage, and sweep on to even greater achievements. British statesmen,
2mo i, 1:therefore, had to be cautious. In such circumstances, instead of
2mo i, 1:cooperating with the autocrats of Russia, Austria, and Prussia, they
2mo i, 1:turned to the minister of the United States in London. The British prime
2mo i, 1:minister, Canning, proposed that the two countries join in declaring
2mo i, 1:their unwillingness to see the Spanish colonies transferred to any other
2mo i, 1:power.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_Jefferson's Advice._--The proposal was rejected; but President Monroe
2mo i, 1:took up the suggestion with Madison and Jefferson as well as with his
2mo i, 1:Secretary of State, John Quincy Adams. They favored the plan. Jefferson
2mo i, 1:said: "One nation, most of all, could disturb us in this pursuit [of
2mo i, 1:freedom]; she now offers to lead, aid, and accompany us in it. By
2mo i, 1:acceding to her proposition we detach her from the bands, bring her
2mo i, 1:mighty weight into the scale of free government and emancipate a
2mo i, 1:continent at one stroke.... With her on our side we need not fear the
2mo i, 1:whole world. With her then we should most sedulously cherish a cordial
2mo i, 1:friendship."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_Monroe's Statement of the Doctrine._--Acting on the advice of trusted
2mo i, 1:friends, President Monroe embodied in his message to Congress, on
2mo i, 1:December 2, 1823, a statement of principles now famous throughout the
2mo i, 1:world as the Monroe Doctrine. To the autocrats of Europe he announced
2mo i, 1:that he would regard "any attempt on their part to extend their system
2mo i, 1:to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety."
2mo i, 1:While he did not propose to interfere with existing colonies dependent
2mo i, 1:on European powers, he ranged himself squarely on the side of those that
2mo i, 1:had declared their independence. Any attempt by a European power to
2mo i, 1:oppress them or control their destiny in any manner he characterized as
2mo i, 1:"a manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States."
2mo i, 1:Referring in another part of his message to a recent claim which the
2mo i, 1:Czar had made to the Pacific coast, President Monroe warned the Old
2mo i, 1:World that "the American continents, by the free and independent
2mo i, 1:condition which they have assumed and maintained, are henceforth not to
2mo i, 1:be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European
2mo i, 1:powers." The effect of this declaration was immediate and profound. Men
2mo i, 1:whose political horizon had been limited to a community or state were
2mo i, 1:led to consider their nation as a great power among the sovereignties of
2mo i, 1:the earth, taking its part in shaping their international relations.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Missouri Compromise.=--Respecting one other important measure of
2mo i, 1:this period, the Republicans also took a broad view of their obligations
2mo i, 1:under the Constitution; namely, the Missouri Compromise. It is true,
2mo i, 1:they insisted on the admission of Missouri as a slave state, balanced
2mo i, 1:against the free state of Maine; but at the same time they assented to
2mo i, 1:the prohibition of slavery in the Louisiana territory north of the line
2mo i, 1:36 o 30'. During the debate on the subject an extreme view had been
2mo i, 1:presented, to the effect that Congress had no constitutional warrant for
2mo i, 1:abolishing slavery in the territories. The precedent of the Northwest
2mo i, 1:Ordinance, ratified by Congress in 1789, seemed a conclusive answer from
2mo i, 1:practice to this contention; but Monroe submitted the issue to his
2mo i, 1:cabinet, which included Calhoun of South Carolina, Crawford of Georgia,
2mo i, 1:and Wirt of Virginia, all presumably adherents to the Jeffersonian
2mo i, 1:principle of strict construction. He received in reply a unanimous
2mo i, 1:verdict to the effect that Congress did have the power to prohibit
2mo i, 1:slavery in the territories governed by it. Acting on this advice he
2mo i, 1:approved, on March 6, 1820, the bill establishing freedom north of the
2mo i, 1:compromise line. This generous interpretation of the powers of Congress
2mo i, 1:stood for nearly forty years, until repudiated by the Supreme Court in
2mo i, 1:the Dred Scott case.

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE NATIONAL DECISIONS OF CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=John Marshall, the Nationalist.=--The Republicans in the lower ranges
2mo i, 1:of state politics, who did not catch the grand national style of their
2mo i, 1:leaders charged with responsibilities in the national field, were
2mo i, 1:assisted in their education by a Federalist from the Old Dominion, John
2mo i, 1:Marshall, who, as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
2mo i, 1:States from 1801 to 1835, lost no occasion to exalt the Constitution
2mo i, 1:above the claims of the provinces. No differences of opinion as to his
2mo i, 1:political views have ever led even his warmest opponents to deny his
2mo i, 1:superb abilities or his sincere devotion to the national idea. All will
2mo i, 1:likewise agree that for talents, native and acquired, he was an ornament
2mo i, 1:to the humble democracy that brought him forth. His whole career was
2mo i, 1:American. Born on the frontier of Virginia, reared in a log cabin,
2mo i, 1:granted only the barest rudiments of education, inured to hardship and
2mo i, 1:rough life, he rose by masterly efforts to the highest judicial honor
2mo i, 1:America can bestow.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:On him the bitter experience of the Revolution and of later days made a
2mo i, 1:lasting impression. He was no "summer patriot." He had been a soldier in
2mo i, 1:the Revolutionary army. He had suffered with Washington at Valley Forge.
2mo i, 1:He had seen his comrades in arms starving and freezing because the
2mo i, 1:Continental Congress had neither the power nor the inclination to force
2mo i, 1:the states to do their full duty. To him the Articles of Confederation
2mo i, 1:were the symbol of futility. Into the struggle for the formation of the
2mo i, 1:Constitution and its ratification in Virginia he had thrown himself with
2mo i, 1:the ardor of a soldier. Later, as a member of Congress, a representative
2mo i, 1:to France, and Secretary of State, he had aided the Federalists in
2mo i, 1:establishing the new government. When at length they were driven from
2mo i, 1:power in the executive and legislative branches of the government, he
2mo i, 1:was chosen for their last stronghold, the Supreme Court. By historic
2mo i, 1:irony he administered the oath of office to his bitterest enemy, Thomas
2mo i, 1:Jefferson; and, long after the author of the Declaration of Independence
2mo i, 1:had retired to private life, the stern Chief Justice continued to
2mo i, 1:announce the old Federalist principles from the Supreme Bench.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: JOHN MARSHALL]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Marbury _vs._ Madison--An Act of Congress Annulled.=--He had been in
2mo i, 1:his high office only two years when he laid down for the first time in
2mo i, 1:the name of the entire Court the doctrine that the judges have the power
2mo i, 1:to declare an act of Congress null and void when in their opinion it
2mo i, 1:violates the Constitution. This power was not expressly conferred on the
2mo i, 1:Court. Though many able men held that the judicial branch of the
2mo i, 1:government enjoyed it, the principle was not positively established
2mo i, 1:until 1803 when the case of Marbury _vs._ Madison was decided. In
2mo i, 1:rendering the opinion of the Court, Marshall cited no precedents. He
2mo i, 1:sought no foundations for his argument in ancient history. He rested it
2mo i, 1:on the general nature of the American system. The Constitution, ran his
2mo i, 1:reasoning, is the supreme law of the land; it limits and binds all who
2mo i, 1:act in the name of the United States; it limits the powers of Congress
2mo i, 1:and defines the rights of citizens. If Congress can ignore its
2mo i, 1:limitations and trespass upon the rights of citizens, Marshall argued,
2mo i, 1:then the Constitution disappears and Congress is supreme. Since,
2mo i, 1:however, the Constitution is supreme and superior to Congress, it is the
2mo i, 1:duty of judges, under their oath of office, to sustain it against
2mo i, 1:measures which violate it. Therefore, from the nature of the American
2mo i, 1:constitutional system the courts must declare null and void all acts
2mo i, 1:which are not authorized. "A law repugnant to the Constitution," he
2mo i, 1:closed, "is void and the courts as well as other departments are bound
2mo i, 1:by that instrument." From that day to this the practice of federal and
2mo i, 1:state courts in passing upon the constitutionality of laws has remained
2mo i, 1:unshaken.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:This doctrine was received by Jefferson and many of his followers with
2mo i, 1:consternation. If the idea was sound, he exclaimed, "then indeed is our
2mo i, 1:Constitution a complete _felo de se_ [legally, a suicide]. For,
2mo i, 1:intending to establish three departments, coordinate and independent
2mo i, 1:that they might check and balance one another, it has given, according
2mo i, 1:to this opinion, to one of them alone the right to prescribe rules for
2mo i, 1:the government of the others, and to that one, too, which is unelected
2mo i, 1:by and independent of the nation.... The Constitution, on this
2mo i, 1:hypothesis, is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary which
2mo i, 1:they may twist and shape into any form they please. It should be
2mo i, 1:remembered, as an axiom of eternal truth in politics, that whatever
2mo i, 1:power in any government is independent, is absolute also.... A judiciary
2mo i, 1:independent of a king or executive alone is a good thing; but
2mo i, 1:independence of the will of the nation is a solecism, at least in a
2mo i, 1:republican government." But Marshall was mighty and his view prevailed,
2mo i, 1:though from time to time other men, clinging to Jefferson's opinion,
2mo i, 1:likewise opposed the exercise by the Courts of the high power of passing
2mo i, 1:upon the constitutionality of acts of Congress.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Acts of State Legislatures Declared Unconstitutional.=--Had Marshall
2mo i, 1:stopped with annulling an act of Congress, he would have heard less
2mo i, 1:criticism from Republican quarters; but, with the same firmness, he set
2mo i, 1:aside acts of state legislatures as well, whenever, in his opinion, they
2mo i, 1:violated the federal Constitution. In 1810, in the case of Fletcher
2mo i, 1:_vs._ Peck, he annulled an act of the Georgia legislature, informing the
2mo i, 1:state that it was not sovereign, but "a part of a large empire, ... a
2mo i, 1:member of the American union; and that union has a constitution ...
2mo i, 1:which imposes limits to the legislatures of the several states." In the
2mo i, 1:case of McCulloch _vs._ Maryland, decided in 1819, he declared void an
2mo i, 1:act of the Maryland legislature designed to paralyze the branches of the
2mo i, 1:United States Bank established in that state. In the same year, in the
2mo i, 1:still more memorable Dartmouth College case, he annulled an act of the
2mo i, 1:New Hampshire legislature which infringed upon the charter received by
2mo i, 1:the college from King George long before. That charter, he declared, was
2mo i, 1:a contract between the state and the college, which the legislature
2mo i, 1:under the federal Constitution could not impair. Two years later he
2mo i, 1:stirred the wrath of Virginia by summoning her to the bar of the Supreme
2mo i, 1:Court to answer in a case in which the validity of one of her laws was
2mo i, 1:involved and then justified his action in a powerful opinion rendered in
2mo i, 1:the case of Cohens _vs._ Virginia.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:All these decisions aroused the legislatures of the states. They passed
2mo i, 1:sheaves of resolutions protesting and condemning; but Marshall never
2mo i, 1:turned and never stayed. The Constitution of the United States, he
2mo i, 1:fairly thundered at them, is the supreme law of the land; the Supreme
2mo i, 1:Court is the proper tribunal to pass finally upon the validity of the
2mo i, 1:laws of the states; and "those sovereignties," far from possessing the
2mo i, 1:right of review and nullification, are irrevocably bound by the
2mo i, 1:decisions of that Court. This was strong medicine for the authors of the
2mo i, 1:Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions and for the members of the Hartford
2mo i, 1:convention; but they had to take it.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Doctrine of Implied Powers.=--While restraining Congress in the
2mo i, 1:Marbury case and the state legislatures in a score of cases, Marshall
2mo i, 1:also laid the judicial foundation for a broad and liberal view of the
2mo i, 1:Constitution as opposed to narrow and strict construction. In McCulloch
2mo i, 1:_vs._ Maryland, he construed generously the words "necessary and proper"
2mo i, 1:in such a way as to confer upon Congress a wide range of "implied
2mo i, 1:powers" in addition to their express powers. That case involved, among
2mo i, 1:other things, the question whether the act establishing the second
2mo i, 1:United States Bank was authorized by the Constitution. Marshall answered
2mo i, 1:in the affirmative. Congress, ran his reasoning, has large powers over
2mo i, 1:taxation and the currency; a bank is of appropriate use in the exercise
2mo i, 1:of these enumerated powers; and therefore, though not absolutely
2mo i, 1:necessary, a bank is entirely proper and constitutional. "With respect
2mo i, 1:to the means by which the powers that the Constitution confers are to be
2mo i, 1:carried into execution," he said, Congress must be allowed the
2mo i, 1:discretion which "will enable that body to perform the high duties
2mo i, 1:assigned to it, in the manner most beneficial to the people." In short,
2mo i, 1:the Constitution of the United States is not a strait jacket but a
2mo i, 1:flexible instrument vesting in Congress the powers necessary to meet
2mo i, 1:national problems as they arise. In delivering this opinion Marshall
2mo i, 1:used language almost identical with that employed by Lincoln when,
2mo i, 1:standing on the battle field of a war waged to preserve the nation, he
2mo i, 1:said that "a government of the people, by the people, for the people
2mo i, 1:shall not perish from the earth."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:SUMMARY OF THE UNION AND NATIONAL POLITICS
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:During the strenuous period between the establishment of American
2mo i, 1:independence and the advent of Jacksonian democracy the great American
2mo i, 1:experiment was under the direction of the men who had launched it. All
2mo i, 1:the Presidents in that period, except John Quincy Adams, had taken part
2mo i, 1:in the Revolution. James Madison, the chief author of the Constitution,
2mo i, 1:lived until 1836. This age, therefore, was the "age of the fathers." It
2mo i, 1:saw the threatened ruin of the country under the Articles of
2mo i, 1:Confederation, the formation of the Constitution, the rise of political
2mo i, 1:parties, the growth of the West, the second war with England, and the
2mo i, 1:apparent triumph of the national spirit over sectionalism.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The new republic had hardly been started in 1783 before its troubles
2mo i, 1:began. The government could not raise money to pay its debts or running
2mo i, 1:expenses; it could not protect American commerce and manufactures
2mo i, 1:against European competition; it could not stop the continual issues of
2mo i, 1:paper money by the states; it could not intervene to put down domestic
2mo i, 1:uprisings that threatened the existence of the state governments.
2mo i, 1:Without money, without an army, without courts of law, the union under
2mo i, 1:the Articles of Confederation was drifting into dissolution. Patriots,
2mo i, 1:who had risked their lives for independence, began to talk of monarchy
2mo i, 1:again. Washington, Hamilton, and Madison insisted that a new
2mo i, 1:constitution alone could save America from disaster.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:By dint of much labor the friends of a new form of government induced
2mo i, 1:the Congress to call a national convention to take into account the
2mo i, 1:state of America. In May, 1787, it assembled at Philadelphia and for
2mo i, 1:months it debated and wrangled over plans for a constitution. The small
2mo i, 1:states clamored for equal rights in the union. The large states vowed
2mo i, 1:that they would never grant it. A spirit of conciliation, fair play, and
2mo i, 1:compromise saved the convention from breaking up. In addition, there
2mo i, 1:were jealousies between the planting states and the commercial states.
2mo i, 1:Here, too, compromises had to be worked out. Some of the delegates
2mo i, 1:feared the growth of democracy and others cherished it. These factions
2mo i, 1:also had to be placated. At last a plan of government was drafted--the
2mo i, 1:Constitution of the United States--and submitted to the states for
2mo i, 1:approval. Only after a long and acrimonious debate did enough states
2mo i, 1:ratify the instrument to put it into effect. On April 30, 1789, George
2mo i, 1:Washington was inaugurated first President.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The new government proceeded to fund the old debt of the nation, assume
2mo i, 1:the debts of the states, found a national bank, lay heavy taxes to pay
2mo i, 1:the bills, and enact laws protecting American industry and commerce.
2mo i, 1:Hamilton led the way, but he had not gone far before he encountered
2mo i, 1:opposition. He found a formidable antagonist in Jefferson. In time two
2mo i, 1:political parties appeared full armed upon the scene: the Federalists
2mo i, 1:and the Republicans. For ten years they filled the country with
2mo i, 1:political debate. In 1800 the Federalists were utterly vanquished by the
2mo i, 1:Republicans with Jefferson in the lead.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:By their proclamations of faith the Republicans favored the states
2mo i, 1:rather than the new national government, but in practice they added
2mo i, 1:immensely to the prestige and power of the nation. They purchased
2mo i, 1:Louisiana from France, they waged a war for commercial independence
2mo i, 1:against England, they created a second United States Bank, they enacted
2mo i, 1:the protective tariff of 1816, they declared that Congress had power to
2mo i, 1:abolish slavery north of the Missouri Compromise line, and they spread
2mo i, 1:the shield of the Monroe Doctrine between the Western Hemisphere and
2mo i, 1:Europe.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Still America was a part of European civilization. Currents of opinion
2mo i, 1:flowed to and fro across the Atlantic. Friends of popular government in
2mo i, 1:Europe looked to America as the great exemplar of their ideals. Events
2mo i, 1:in Europe reacted upon thought in the United States. The French
2mo i, 1:Revolution exerted a profound influence on the course of political
2mo i, 1:debate. While it was in the stage of mere reform all Americans favored
2mo i, 1:it. When the king was executed and a radical democracy set up, American
2mo i, 1:opinion was divided. When France fell under the military dominion of
2mo i, 1:Napoleon and preyed upon American commerce, the United States made ready
2mo i, 1:for war.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The conduct of England likewise affected American affairs. In 1793 war
2mo i, 1:broke out between England and France and raged with only a slight
2mo i, 1:intermission until 1815. England and France both ravaged American
2mo i, 1:commerce, but England was the more serious offender because she had
2mo i, 1:command of the seas. Though Jefferson and Madison strove for peace, the
2mo i, 1:country was swept into war by the vehemence of the "Young Republicans,"
2mo i, 1:headed by Clay and Calhoun.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:When the armed conflict was closed, one in diplomacy opened. The
2mo i, 1:autocratic powers of Europe threatened to intervene on behalf of Spain
2mo i, 1:in her attempt to recover possession of her Latin-American colonies.
2mo i, 1:Their challenge to America brought forth the Monroe Doctrine. The powers
2mo i, 1:of Europe were warned not to interfere with the independence or the
2mo i, 1:republican policies of this hemisphere or to attempt any new
2mo i, 1:colonization in it. It seemed that nationalism was to have a peaceful
2mo i, 1:triumph over sectionalism.

2mo i, 1:CHAPTER X
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE FARMERS BEYOND THE APPALACHIANS
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The nationalism of Hamilton was undemocratic. The democracy of Jefferson
2mo i, 1:was, in the beginning, provincial. The historic mission of uniting
2mo i, 1:nationalism and democracy was in the course of time given to new leaders
2mo i, 1:from a region beyond the mountains, peopled by men and women from all
2mo i, 1:sections and free from those state traditions which ran back to the
2mo i, 1:early days of colonization. The voice of the democratic nationalism
2mo i, 1:nourished in the West was heard when Clay of Kentucky advocated his
2mo i, 1:American system of protection for industries; when Jackson of Tennessee
2mo i, 1:condemned nullification in a ringing proclamation that has taken its
2mo i, 1:place among the great American state papers; and when Lincoln of
2mo i, 1:Illinois, in a fateful hour, called upon a bewildered people to meet the
2mo i, 1:supreme test whether this was a nation destined to survive or to perish.
2mo i, 1:And it will be remembered that Lincoln's party chose for its banner that
2mo i, 1:earlier device--Republican--which Jefferson had made a sign of power.
2mo i, 1:The "rail splitter" from Illinois united the nationalism of Hamilton
2mo i, 1:with the democracy of Jefferson, and his appeal was clothed in the
2mo i, 1:simple language of the people, not in the sonorous rhetoric which
2mo i, 1:Webster learned in the schools.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:PREPARATION FOR WESTERN SETTLEMENT
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The West and the American Revolution.=--The excessive attention devoted
2mo i, 1:by historians to the military operations along the coast has obscured
2mo i, 1:the role played by the frontier in the American Revolution. The action
2mo i, 1:of Great Britain in closing western land to easy settlement in 1763 was
2mo i, 1:more than an incident in precipitating the war for independence.
2mo i, 1:Americans on the frontier did not forget it; when Indians were employed
2mo i, 1:by England to defend that land, zeal for the patriot cause set the
2mo i, 1:interior aflame. It was the members of the western vanguard, like Daniel
2mo i, 1:Boone, John Sevier, and George Rogers Clark, who first understood the
2mo i, 1:value of the far-away country under the guns of the English forts, where
2mo i, 1:the Red Men still wielded the tomahawk and the scalping knife. It was
2mo i, 1:they who gave the East no rest until their vision was seen by the
2mo i, 1:leaders on the seaboard who directed the course of national policy. It
2mo i, 1:was one of their number, a seasoned Indian fighter, George Rogers Clark,
2mo i, 1:who with aid from Virginia seized Kaskaskia and Vincennes and secured
2mo i, 1:the whole Northwest to the union while the fate of Washington's army was
2mo i, 1:still hanging in the balance.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Western Problems at the End of the Revolution.=--The treaty of peace,
2mo i, 1:signed with Great Britain in 1783, brought the definite cession of the
2mo i, 1:coveted territory west to the Mississippi River, but it left unsolved
2mo i, 1:many problems. In the first place, tribes of resentful Indians in the
2mo i, 1:Ohio region, even though British support was withdrawn at last, had to
2mo i, 1:be reckoned with; and it was not until after the establishment of the
2mo i, 1:federal Constitution that a well-equipped army could be provided to
2mo i, 1:guarantee peace on the border. In the second place, British garrisons
2mo i, 1:still occupied forts on Lake Erie pending the execution of the terms of
2mo i, 1:the treaty of 1783--terms which were not fulfilled until after the
2mo i, 1:ratification of the Jay treaty twelve years later. In the third place,
2mo i, 1:Virginia, Connecticut, and Massachusetts had conflicting claims to the
2mo i, 1:land in the Northwest based on old English charters and Indian treaties.
2mo i, 1:It was only after a bitter contest that the states reached an agreement
2mo i, 1:to transfer their rights to the government of the United States,
2mo i, 1:Virginia executing her deed of cession on March 1, 1784. In the fourth
2mo i, 1:place, titles to lands bought by individuals remained uncertain in the
2mo i, 1:absence of official maps and records. To meet this last situation,
2mo i, 1:Congress instituted a systematic survey of the Ohio country, laying it
2mo i, 1:out into townships, sections of 640 acres each, and quarter sections. In
2mo i, 1:every township one section of land was set aside for the support of
2mo i, 1:public schools.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Northwest Ordinance.=--The final problem which had to be solved
2mo i, 1:before settlement on a large scale could be begun was that of governing
2mo i, 1:the territory. Pioneers who looked with hungry eyes on the fertile
2mo i, 1:valley of the Ohio could hardly restrain their impatience. Soldiers of
2mo i, 1:the Revolution, who had been paid for their services in land warrants
2mo i, 1:entitling them to make entries in the West, called for action.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Congress answered by passing in 1787 the famous Northwest Ordinance
2mo i, 1:providing for temporary territorial government to be followed by the
2mo i, 1:creation of a popular assembly as soon as there were five thousand free
2mo i, 1:males in any district. Eventual admission to the union on an equal
2mo i, 1:footing with the original states was promised to the new territories.
2mo i, 1:Religious freedom was guaranteed. The safeguards of trial by jury,
2mo i, 1:regular judicial procedure, and _habeas corpus_ were established, in order
2mo i, 1:that the methods of civilized life might take the place of the
2mo i, 1:rough-and-ready justice of lynch law. During the course of the debate on
2mo i, 1:the Ordinance, Congress added the sixth article forbidding slavery and
2mo i, 1:involuntary servitude.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:This Charter of the Northwest, so well planned by the Congress under the
2mo i, 1:Articles of Confederation, was continued in force by the first Congress
2mo i, 1:under the Constitution in 1789. The following year its essential
2mo i, 1:provisions, except the ban on slavery, were applied to the territory
2mo i, 1:south of the Ohio, ceded by North Carolina to the national government,
2mo i, 1:and in 1798 to the Mississippi territory, once held by Georgia. Thus it
2mo i, 1:was settled for all time that "the new colonies were not to be exploited
2mo i, 1:for the benefit of the parent states (any more than for the benefit of
2mo i, 1:England) but were to be autonomous and coordinate commonwealths." This
2mo i, 1:outcome, bitterly opposed by some Eastern leaders who feared the triumph
2mo i, 1:of Western states over the seaboard, completed the legal steps necessary
2mo i, 1:by way of preparation for the flood of settlers.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Land Companies, Speculators, and Western Land Tenure.=--As in the
2mo i, 1:original settlement of America, so in the opening of the West, great
2mo i, 1:companies and single proprietors of large grants early figured. In 1787
2mo i, 1:the Ohio Land Company, a New England concern, acquired a million and a
2mo i, 1:half acres on the Ohio and began operations by planting the town of
2mo i, 1:Marietta. A professional land speculator, J.C. Symmes, secured a million
2mo i, 1:acres lower down where the city of Cincinnati was founded. Other
2mo i, 1:individuals bought up soldiers' claims and so acquired enormous holdings
2mo i, 1:for speculative purposes. Indeed, there was such a rush to make fortunes
2mo i, 1:quickly through the rise in land values that Washington was moved to cry
2mo i, 1:out against the "rage for speculating in and forestalling of land on the
2mo i, 1:North West of the Ohio," protesting that "scarce a valuable spot within
2mo i, 1:any tolerable distance of it is left without a claimant." He therefore
2mo i, 1:urged Congress to fix a reasonable price for the land, not "too
2mo i, 1:exorbitant and burdensome for real occupiers, but high enough to
2mo i, 1:discourage monopolizers."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Congress, however, was not prepared to use the public domain for the
2mo i, 1:sole purpose of developing a body of small freeholders in the West. It
2mo i, 1:still looked upon the sale of public lands as an important source of
2mo i, 1:revenue with which to pay off the public debt; consequently it thought
2mo i, 1:more of instant income than of ultimate results. It placed no limit on
2mo i, 1:the amount which could be bought when it fixed the price at $2 an acre
2mo i, 1:in 1796, and it encouraged the professional land operator by making the
2mo i, 1:first installment only twenty cents an acre in addition to the small
2mo i, 1:registration and survey fee. On such terms a speculator with a few
2mo i, 1:thousand dollars could get possession of an enormous plot of land. If he
2mo i, 1:was fortunate in disposing of it, he could meet the installments, which
2mo i, 1:were spread over a period of four years, and make a handsome profit for
2mo i, 1:himself. Even when the credit or installment feature was abolished in
2mo i, 1:1821 and the price of the land lowered to a cash price of $1.75 an acre,
2mo i, 1:the opportunity for large speculative purchases continued to attract
2mo i, 1:capital to land ventures.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Development of the Small Freehold.=--The cheapness of land and the
2mo i, 1:scarcity of labor, nevertheless, made impossible the triumph of the huge
2mo i, 1:estate with its semi-servile tenantry. For about $45 a man could get a
2mo i, 1:farm of 160 acres on the installment plan; another payment of $80 was
2mo i, 1:due in forty days; but a four-year term was allowed for the discharge of
2mo i, 1:the balance. With a capital of from two to three hundred dollars a
2mo i, 1:family could embark on a land venture. If it had good crops, it could
2mo i, 1:meet the deferred payments. It was, however, a hard battle at best. Many
2mo i, 1:a man forfeited his land through failure to pay the final installment;
2mo i, 1:yet in the end, in spite of all the handicaps, the small freehold of a
2mo i, 1:few hundred acres at most became the typical unit of Western
2mo i, 1:agriculture, except in the planting states of the Gulf. Even the lands
2mo i, 1:of the great companies were generally broken up and sold in small lots.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The tendency toward moderate holdings, so favored by Western conditions,
2mo i, 1:was also promoted by a clause in the Northwest Ordinance declaring that
2mo i, 1:the land of any person dying intestate--that is, without any will
2mo i, 1:disposing of it--should be divided equally among his descendants.
2mo i, 1:Hildreth says of this provision: "It established the important
2mo i, 1:republican principle, not then introduced into all the states, of the
2mo i, 1:equal distribution of landed as well as personal property." All these
2mo i, 1:forces combined made the wide dispersion of wealth, in the early days of
2mo i, 1:the nineteenth century, an American characteristic, in marked contrast
2mo i, 1:with the European system of family prestige and vast estates based on
2mo i, 1:the law of primogeniture.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE WESTERN MIGRATION AND NEW STATES
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The People.=--With government established, federal arms victorious over
2mo i, 1:the Indians, and the lands surveyed for sale, the way was prepared for
2mo i, 1:the immigrants. They came with a rush. Young New Englanders, weary of
2mo i, 1:tilling the stony soil of their native states, poured through New York
2mo i, 1:and Pennsylvania, some settling on the northern bank of the Ohio but
2mo i, 1:most of them in the Lake region. Sons and daughters of German farmers in
2mo i, 1:Pennsylvania and many a redemptioner who had discharged his bond of
2mo i, 1:servitude pressed out into Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, or beyond. From
2mo i, 1:the exhausted fields and the clay hills of the Southern states came
2mo i, 1:pioneers of English and Scotch-Irish descent, the latter in great
2mo i, 1:numbers. Indeed one historian of high authority has ventured to say that
2mo i, 1:"the rapid expansion of the United States from a coast strip to a
2mo i, 1:continental area is largely a Scotch-Irish achievement." While native
2mo i, 1:Americans of mixed stocks led the way into the West, it was not long
2mo i, 1:before immigrants direct from Europe, under the stimulus of company
2mo i, 1:enterprise, began to filter into the new settlements in increasing
2mo i, 1:numbers.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The types of people were as various as the nations they represented.
2mo i, 1:Timothy Flint, who published his entertaining _Recollections_ in 1826,
2mo i, 1:found the West a strange mixture of all sorts and conditions of people.
2mo i, 1:Some of them, he relates, had been hunters in the upper world of the
2mo i, 1:Mississippi, above the falls of St. Anthony. Some had been still farther
2mo i, 1:north, in Canada. Still others had wandered from the South--the Gulf of
2mo i, 1:Mexico, the Red River, and the Spanish country. French boatmen and
2mo i, 1:trappers, Spanish traders from the Southwest, Virginia planters with
2mo i, 1:their droves of slaves mingled with English, German, and Scotch-Irish
2mo i, 1:farmers. Hunters, forest rangers, restless bordermen, and squatters,
2mo i, 1:like the foaming combers of an advancing tide, went first. Then followed
2mo i, 1:the farmers, masters of the ax and plow, with their wives who shared
2mo i, 1:every burden and hardship and introduced some of the features of
2mo i, 1:civilized life. The hunters and rangers passed on to new scenes; the
2mo i, 1:home makers built for all time.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Number of Immigrants.=--There were no official stations on the
2mo i, 1:frontier to record the number of immigrants who entered the West during
2mo i, 1:the decades following the American Revolution. But travelers of the time
2mo i, 1:record that every road was "crowded" with pioneers and their families,
2mo i, 1:their wagons and cattle; and that they were seldom out of the sound of
2mo i, 1:the snapping whip of the teamster urging forward his horses or the crack
2mo i, 1:of the hunter's rifle as he brought down his evening meal. "During the
2mo i, 1:latter half of 1787," says Coman, "more than nine hundred boats floated
2mo i, 1:down the Ohio carrying eighteen thousand men, women, and children, and
2mo i, 1:twelve thousand horses, sheep, and cattle, and six hundred and fifty
2mo i, 1:wagons." Other lines of travel were also crowded and with the passing
2mo i, 1:years the flooding tide of home seekers rose higher and higher.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Western Routes.=--Four main routes led into the country beyond the
2mo i, 1:Appalachians. The Genesee road, beginning at Albany, ran almost due west
2mo i, 1:to the present site of Buffalo on Lake Erie, through a level country. In
2mo i, 1:the dry season, wagons laden with goods could easily pass along it into
2mo i, 1:northern Ohio. A second route, through Pittsburgh, was fed by three
2mo i, 1:eastern branches, one starting at Philadelphia, one at Baltimore, and
2mo i, 1:another at Alexandria. A third main route wound through the mountains
2mo i, 1:from Alexandria to Boonesboro in Kentucky and then westward across the
2mo i, 1:Ohio to St. Louis. A fourth, the most famous of them all, passed through
2mo i, 1:the Cumberland Gap and by branches extended into the Cumberland valley
2mo i, 1:and the Kentucky country.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Of these four lines of travel, the Pittsburgh route offered the most
2mo i, 1:advantages. Pioneers, no matter from what section they came, when once
2mo i, 1:they were on the headwaters of the Ohio and in possession of a flatboat,
2mo i, 1:could find a quick and easy passage into all parts of the West and
2mo i, 1:Southwest. Whether they wanted to settle in Ohio, Kentucky, or western
2mo i, 1:Tennessee they could find their way down the drifting flood to their
2mo i, 1:destination or at least to some spot near it. Many people from the South
2mo i, 1:as well as the Northern and Middle states chose this route; so it came
2mo i, 1:about that the sons and daughters of Virginia and the Carolinas mingled
2mo i, 1:with those of New York, Pennsylvania, and New England in the settlement
2mo i, 1:of the Northwest territory.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Methods of Travel into the West.=--Many stories giving exact
2mo i, 1:descriptions of methods of travel into the West in the early days have
2mo i, 1:been preserved. The country was hardly opened before visitors from the
2mo i, 1:Old World and from the Eastern states, impelled by curiosity, made their
2mo i, 1:way to the very frontier of civilization and wrote books to inform or
2mo i, 1:amuse the public. One of them, Gilbert Imlay, an English traveler, has
2mo i, 1:given us an account of the Pittsburgh route as he found it in 1791. "If
2mo i, 1:a man ... " he writes, "has a family or goods of any sort to remove, his
2mo i, 1:best way, then, would be to purchase a waggon and team of horses to
2mo i, 1:carry his property to Redstone Old Fort or to Pittsburgh, according as
2mo i, 1:he may come from the Northern or Southern states. A good waggon will
2mo i, 1:cost, at Philadelphia, about $10 ... and the horses about $12 each; they
2mo i, 1:would cost something more both at Baltimore and Alexandria. The waggon
2mo i, 1:may be covered with canvass, and if it is the choice of the people, they
2mo i, 1:may sleep in it of nights with the greatest safety. But if they dislike
2mo i, 1:that, there are inns of accommodation the whole distance on the
2mo i, 1:different roads.... The provisions I would purchase in the same manner
2mo i, 1:[that is, from the farmers along the road]; and by having two or three
2mo i, 1:camp kettles and stopping every evening when the weather is fine upon
2mo i, 1:the brink of some rivulet and by kindling a fire they may soon dress
2mo i, 1:their own food.... This manner of journeying is so far from being
2mo i, 1:disagreeable that in a fine season it is extremely pleasant." The
2mo i, 1:immigrant once at Pittsburgh or Wheeling could then buy a flatboat of a
2mo i, 1:size required for his goods and stock, and drift down the current to his
2mo i, 1:journey's end.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: ROADS AND TRAILS INTO THE WESTERN TERRITORY]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Admission of Kentucky and Tennessee.=--When the eighteenth century
2mo i, 1:drew to a close, Kentucky had a population larger than Delaware, Rhode
2mo i, 1:Island, or New Hampshire. Tennessee claimed 60,000 inhabitants. In 1792
2mo i, 1:Kentucky took her place as a state beside her none too kindly parent,
2mo i, 1:Virginia. The Eastern Federalists resented her intrusion; but they took
2mo i, 1:some consolation in the admission of Vermont because the balance of
2mo i, 1:Eastern power was still retained.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:As if to assert their independence of old homes and conservative ideas
2mo i, 1:the makers of Kentucky's first constitution swept aside the landed
2mo i, 1:qualification on the suffrage and gave the vote to all free white males.
2mo i, 1:Four years later, Kentucky's neighbor to the south, Tennessee, followed
2mo i, 1:this step toward a wider democracy. After encountering fierce opposition
2mo i, 1:from the Federalists, Tennessee was accepted as the sixteenth state.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Ohio.=--The door of the union had hardly opened for Tennessee when
2mo i, 1:another appeal was made to Congress, this time from the pioneers in
2mo i, 1:Ohio. The little posts founded at Marietta and Cincinnati had grown into
2mo i, 1:flourishing centers of trade. The stream of immigrants, flowing down the
2mo i, 1:river, added daily to their numbers and the growing settlements all
2mo i, 1:around poured produce into their markets to be exchanged for "store
2mo i, 1:goods." After the Indians were disposed of in 1794 and the last British
2mo i, 1:soldier left the frontier forts under the terms of the Jay treaty of
2mo i, 1:1795, tiny settlements of families appeared on Lake Erie in the "Western
2mo i, 1:Reserve," a region that had been retained by Connecticut when she
2mo i, 1:surrendered her other rights in the Northwest.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:At the close of the century, Ohio, claiming a population of more than
2mo i, 1:50,000, grew discontented with its territorial status. Indeed, two years
2mo i, 1:before the enactment of the Northwest Ordinance, squatters in that
2mo i, 1:region had been invited by one John Emerson to hold a convention after
2mo i, 1:the fashion of the men of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield in old
2mo i, 1:Connecticut and draft a frame of government for themselves. This true
2mo i, 1:son of New England declared that men "have an undoubted right to pass
2mo i, 1:into every vacant country and there to form their constitution and that
2mo i, 1:from the confederation of the whole United States Congress is not
2mo i, 1:empowered to forbid them." This grand convention was never held because
2mo i, 1:the heavy hand of the government fell upon the leaders; but the spirit
2mo i, 1:of John Emerson did not perish. In November, 1802, a convention chosen
2mo i, 1:by voters, assembled under the authority of Congress at Chillicothe,
2mo i, 1:drew up a constitution. It went into force after a popular ratification.
2mo i, 1:The roll of the convention bore such names as Abbot, Baldwin, Cutler,
2mo i, 1:Huntington, Putnam, and Sargent, and the list of counties from which
2mo i, 1:they came included Adams, Fairfield, Hamilton, Jefferson, Trumbull, and
2mo i, 1:Washington, showing that the new America in the West was peopled and led
2mo i, 1:by the old stock. In 1803 Ohio was admitted to the union.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Indiana and Illinois.=--As in the neighboring state, the frontier in
2mo i, 1:Indiana advanced northward from the Ohio, mainly under the leadership,
2mo i, 1:however, of settlers from the South--restless Kentuckians hoping for
2mo i, 1:better luck in a newer country and pioneers from the far frontiers of
2mo i, 1:Virginia and North Carolina. As soon as a tier of counties swinging
2mo i, 1:upward like the horns of the moon against Ohio on the east and in the
2mo i, 1:Wabash Valley on the west was fairly settled, a clamor went up for
2mo i, 1:statehood. Under the authority of an act of Congress in 1816 the
2mo i, 1:Indianians drafted a constitution and inaugurated their government at
2mo i, 1:Corydon. "The majority of the members of the convention," we are told by
2mo i, 1:a local historian, "were frontier farmers who had a general idea of what
2mo i, 1:they wanted and had sense enough to let their more erudite colleagues
2mo i, 1:put it into shape."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Two years later, the pioneers of Illinois, also settled upward from the
2mo i, 1:Ohio, like Indiana, elected their delegates to draft a constitution.
2mo i, 1:Leadership in the convention, quite properly, was taken by a man born in
2mo i, 1:New York and reared in Tennessee; and the constitution as finally
2mo i, 1:drafted "was in its principal provisions a copy of the then existing
2mo i, 1:constitutions of Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana.... Many of the articles
2mo i, 1:are exact copies in wording although differently arranged and
2mo i, 1:numbered."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.=--Across the Mississippi to the
2mo i, 1:far south, clearing and planting had gone on with much bustle and
2mo i, 1:enterprise. The cotton and sugar lands of Louisiana, opened by French
2mo i, 1:and Spanish settlers, were widened in every direction by planters with
2mo i, 1:their armies of slaves from the older states. New Orleans, a good market
2mo i, 1:and a center of culture not despised even by the pioneer, grew apace. In
2mo i, 1:1810 the population of lower Louisiana was over 75,000. The time had
2mo i, 1:come, said the leaders of the people, to fulfill the promise made to
2mo i, 1:France in the treaty of cession; namely, to grant to the inhabitants of
2mo i, 1:the territory statehood and the rights of American citizens. Federalists
2mo i, 1:from New England still having a voice in Congress, if somewhat weaker,
2mo i, 1:still protested in tones of horror. "I am compelled to declare it as my
2mo i, 1:deliberate opinion," pronounced Josiah Quincy in the House of
2mo i, 1:Representatives, "that if this bill [to admit Louisiana] passes, the
2mo i, 1:bonds of this Union are virtually dissolved ... that as it will be the
2mo i, 1:right of all, so it will be the duty of some [states] to prepare
2mo i, 1:definitely for a separation; amicably if they can, violently if they
2mo i, 1:must.... It is a death blow to the Constitution. It may afterwards
2mo i, 1:linger; but lingering, its fate will, at no very distant period, be
2mo i, 1:consummated." Federalists from New York like those from New England had
2mo i, 1:their doubts about the wisdom of admitting Western states; but the party
2mo i, 1:of Jefferson and Madison, having the necessary majority, granted the
2mo i, 1:coveted statehood to Louisiana in 1812.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:When, a few years later, Mississippi and Alabama knocked at the doors of
2mo i, 1:the union, the Federalists had so little influence, on account of their
2mo i, 1:conduct during the second war with England, that spokesmen from the
2mo i, 1:Southwest met a kindlier reception at Washington. Mississippi, in 1817,
2mo i, 1:and Alabama, in 1819, took their places among the United States of
2mo i, 1:America. Both of them, while granting white manhood suffrage, gave their
2mo i, 1:constitutions the tone of the old East by providing landed
2mo i, 1:qualifications for the governor and members of the legislature.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Missouri.=--Far to the north in the Louisiana purchase, a new
2mo i, 1:commonwealth was rising to power. It was peopled by immigrants who came
2mo i, 1:down the Ohio in fleets of boats or crossed the Mississippi from
2mo i, 1:Kentucky and Tennessee. Thrifty Germans from Pennsylvania, hardy farmers
2mo i, 1:from Virginia ready to work with their own hands, freemen seeking
2mo i, 1:freemen's homes, planters with their slaves moving on from worn-out
2mo i, 1:fields on the seaboard, came together in the widening settlements of the
2mo i, 1:Missouri country. Peoples from the North and South flowed together,
2mo i, 1:small farmers and big planters mingling in one community. When their
2mo i, 1:numbers had reached sixty thousand or more, they precipitated a contest
2mo i, 1:over their admission to the union, "ringing an alarm bell in the night,"
2mo i, 1:as Jefferson phrased it. The favorite expedient of compromise with
2mo i, 1:slavery was brought forth in Congress once more. Maine consequently was
2mo i, 1:brought into the union without slavery and Missouri with slavery. At the
2mo i, 1:same time there was drawn westward through the rest of the Louisiana
2mo i, 1:territory a line separating servitude from slavery.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE SPIRIT OF THE FRONTIER
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Land Tenure and Liberty.=--Over an immense western area there developed
2mo i, 1:an unbroken system of freehold farms. In the Gulf states and the lower
2mo i, 1:Mississippi Valley, it is true, the planter with his many slaves even
2mo i, 1:led in the pioneer movement; but through large sections of Tennessee and
2mo i, 1:Kentucky, as well as upper Georgia and Alabama, and all throughout the
2mo i, 1:Northwest territory the small farmer reigned supreme. In this immense
2mo i, 1:dominion there sprang up a civilization without caste or class--a body
2mo i, 1:of people all having about the same amount of this world's goods and
2mo i, 1:deriving their livelihood from one source: the labor of their own hands
2mo i, 1:on the soil. The Northwest territory alone almost equaled in area all
2mo i, 1:the original thirteen states combined, except Georgia, and its system of
2mo i, 1:agricultural economy was unbroken by plantations and feudal estates. "In
2mo i, 1:the subdivision of the soil and the great equality of condition," as
2mo i, 1:Webster said on more than one occasion, "lay the true basis, most
2mo i, 1:certainly, of popular government." There was the undoubted source of
2mo i, 1:Jacksonian democracy.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: A LOG CABIN--LINCOLN'S BIRTHPLACE]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Characteristics of the Western People.=--Travelers into the
2mo i, 1:Northwest during the early years of the nineteenth century were agreed
2mo i, 1:that the people of that region were almost uniformly marked by the
2mo i, 1:characteristics common to an independent yeomanry. A close observer thus
2mo i, 1:recorded his impressions: "A spirit of adventurous enterprise, a
2mo i, 1:willingness to go through any hardship to accomplish an object....
2mo i, 1:Independence of thought and action. They have felt the influence of
2mo i, 1:these principles from their childhood. Men who can endure anything; that
2mo i, 1:have lived almost without restraint, free as the mountain air or as the
2mo i, 1:deer and the buffalo of their forests, and who know they are Americans
2mo i, 1:all.... An apparent roughness which some would deem rudeness of
2mo i, 1:manner.... Where there is perfect equality in a neighborhood of people
2mo i, 1:who know little about each other's previous history or ancestry but
2mo i, 1:where each is lord of the soil he cultivates. Where a log cabin is all
2mo i, 1:that the best of families can expect to have for years and of course can
2mo i, 1:possess few of the external decorations which have so much influence in
2mo i, 1:creating a diversity of rank in society. These circumstances have laid
2mo i, 1:the foundation for that equality of intercourse, simplicity of manners,
2mo i, 1:want of deference, want of reserve, great readiness to make
2mo i, 1:acquaintances, freedom of speech, indisposition to brook real or
2mo i, 1:imaginary insults which one witnesses among people of the West."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:This equality, this independence, this rudeness so often described by
2mo i, 1:the traveler as marking a new country, were all accentuated by the
2mo i, 1:character of the settlers themselves. Traces of the fierce, unsociable,
2mo i, 1:eagle-eyed, hard-drinking hunter remained. The settlers who followed the
2mo i, 1:hunter were, with some exceptions, soldiers of the Revolutionary army,
2mo i, 1:farmers of the "middling order," and mechanics from the towns,--English,
2mo i, 1:Scotch-Irish, Germans,--poor in possessions and thrown upon the labor of
2mo i, 1:their own hands for support. Sons and daughters from well-to-do Eastern
2mo i, 1:homes sometimes brought softer manners; but the equality of life and the
2mo i, 1:leveling force of labor in forest and field soon made them one in spirit
2mo i, 1:with their struggling neighbors. Even the preachers and teachers, who
2mo i, 1:came when the cabins were raised in the clearings and rude churches and
2mo i, 1:schoolhouses were built, preached sermons and taught lessons that
2mo i, 1:savored of the frontier, as any one may know who reads Peter
2mo i, 1:Cartwright's _A Muscular Christian_ or Eggleston's _The Hoosier
2mo i, 1:Schoolmaster_.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE WEST AND THE EAST MEET
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The East Alarmed.=--A people so independent as the Westerners and so
2mo i, 1:attached to local self-government gave the conservative East many a rude
2mo i, 1:shock, setting gentlemen in powdered wigs and knee breeches agog with
2mo i, 1:the idea that terrible things might happen in the Mississippi Valley.
2mo i, 1:Not without good grounds did Washington fear that "a touch of a feather
2mo i, 1:would turn" the Western settlers away from the seaboard to the
2mo i, 1:Spaniards; and seriously did he urge the East not to neglect them, lest
2mo i, 1:they be "drawn into the arms of, or be dependent upon foreigners."
2mo i, 1:Taking advantage of the restless spirit in the Southwest, Aaron Burr,
2mo i, 1:having disgraced himself by killing Alexander Hamilton in a duel, laid
2mo i, 1:wild plans, if not to bring about a secession in that region, at least
2mo i, 1:to build a state of some kind out of the Spanish dominions adjoining
2mo i, 1:Louisiana. Frightened at such enterprises and fearing the dominance of
2mo i, 1:the West, the Federalists, with a few conspicuous exceptions, opposed
2mo i, 1:equality between the sections. Had their narrow views prevailed, the
2mo i, 1:West, with its new democracy, would have been held in perpetual tutelage
2mo i, 1:to the seaboard or perhaps been driven into independence as the thirteen
2mo i, 1:colonies had been not long before.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Eastern Friends of the West.=--Fortunately for the nation, there were
2mo i, 1:many Eastern leaders, particularly from the South, who understood the
2mo i, 1:West, approved its spirit, and sought to bring the two sections together
2mo i, 1:by common bonds. Washington kept alive and keen the zeal for Western
2mo i, 1:advancement which he acquired in his youth as a surveyor. He never grew
2mo i, 1:tired of urging upon his Eastern friends the importance of the lands
2mo i, 1:beyond the mountains. He pressed upon the governor of Virginia a project
2mo i, 1:for a wagon road connecting the seaboard with the Ohio country and was
2mo i, 1:active in a movement to improve the navigation of the Potomac. He
2mo i, 1:advocated strengthening the ties of commerce. "Smooth the roads," he
2mo i, 1:said, "and make easy the way for them, and then see what an influx of
2mo i, 1:articles will be poured upon us; how amazingly our exports will be
2mo i, 1:increased by them; and how amply we shall be compensated for any trouble
2mo i, 1:and expense we may encounter to effect it." Jefferson, too, was
2mo i, 1:interested in every phase of Western development--the survey of lands,
2mo i, 1:the exploration of waterways, the opening of trade, and even the
2mo i, 1:discovery of the bones of prehistoric animals. Robert Fulton, the
2mo i, 1:inventor of the steamboat, was another man of vision who for many years
2mo i, 1:pressed upon his countrymen the necessity of uniting East and West by a
2mo i, 1:canal which would cement the union, raise the value of the public lands,
2mo i, 1:and extend the principles of confederate and republican government.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Difficulties of Early Transportation.=--Means of communication
2mo i, 1:played an important part in the strategy of all those who sought to
2mo i, 1:bring together the seaboard and the frontier. The produce of the
2mo i, 1:West--wheat, corn, bacon, hemp, cattle, and tobacco--was bulky and the
2mo i, 1:cost of overland transportation was prohibitive. In the Eastern market,
2mo i, 1:"a cow and her calf were given for a bushel of salt, while a suit of
2mo i, 1:'store clothes' cost as much as a farm." In such circumstances, the
2mo i, 1:inhabitants of the Mississippi Valley were forced to ship their produce
2mo i, 1:over a long route by way of New Orleans and to pay high freight rates
2mo i, 1:for everything that was brought across the mountains. Scows of from five
2mo i, 1:to fifty tons were built at the towns along the rivers and piloted down
2mo i, 1:the stream to the Crescent City. In a few cases small ocean-going
2mo i, 1:vessels were built to transport goods to the West Indies or to the
2mo i, 1:Eastern coast towns. Salt, iron, guns, powder, and the absolute
2mo i, 1:essentials which the pioneers had to buy mainly in Eastern markets were
2mo i, 1:carried over narrow wagon trails that were almost impassable in the
2mo i, 1:rainy season.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The National Road.=--To far-sighted men, like Albert Gallatin, "the
2mo i, 1:father of internal improvements," the solution of this problem was the
2mo i, 1:construction of roads and canals. Early in Jefferson's administration,
2mo i, 1:Congress dedicated a part of the proceeds from the sale of lands to
2mo i, 1:building highways from the headwaters of the navigable waters emptying
2mo i, 1:into the Atlantic to the Ohio River and beyond into the Northwest
2mo i, 1:territory. In 1806, after many misgivings, it authorized a great
2mo i, 1:national highway binding the East and the West. The Cumberland Road, as
2mo i, 1:it was called, began in northwestern Maryland, wound through southern
2mo i, 1:Pennsylvania, crossed the narrow neck of Virginia at Wheeling, and then
2mo i, 1:shot almost straight across Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, into Missouri.
2mo i, 1:By 1817, stagecoaches were running between Washington and Wheeling; by
2mo i, 1:1833 contractors had carried their work to Columbus, Ohio, and by 1852,
2mo i, 1:to Vandalia, Illinois. Over this ballasted road mail and passenger
2mo i, 1:coaches could go at high speed, and heavy freight wagons proceed in
2mo i, 1:safety at a steady pace.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: THE CUMBERLAND ROAD]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Canals and Steamboats.=--A second epoch in the economic union of the
2mo i, 1:East and West was reached with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825,
2mo i, 1:offering an all-water route from New York City to the Great Lakes and
2mo i, 1:the Mississippi Valley. Pennsylvania, alarmed by the advantages
2mo i, 1:conferred on New York by this enterprise, began her system of canals and
2mo i, 1:portages from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, completing the last link in
2mo i, 1:1834. In the South, the Chesapeake and Ohio Company, chartered in 1825,
2mo i, 1:was busy with a project to connect Georgetown and Cumberland when
2mo i, 1:railways broke in upon the undertaking before it was half finished.
2mo i, 1:About the same time, Ohio built a canal across the state, affording
2mo i, 1:water communication between Lake Erie and the Ohio River through a rich
2mo i, 1:wheat belt. Passengers could now travel by canal boat into the West with
2mo i, 1:comparative ease and comfort, if not at a rapid speed, and the bulkiest
2mo i, 1:of freight could be easily handled. Moreover, the rate charged for
2mo i, 1:carrying goods was cut by the Erie Canal from $32 a ton per hundred
2mo i, 1:miles to $1. New Orleans was destined to lose her primacy in the
2mo i, 1:Mississippi Valley.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The diversion of traffic to Eastern markets was also stimulated by
2mo i, 1:steamboats which appeared on the Ohio about 1810, three years after
2mo i, 1:Fulton had made his famous trip on the Hudson. It took twenty men to
2mo i, 1:sail and row a five-ton scow up the river at a speed of from ten to
2mo i, 1:twenty miles a day. In 1825, Timothy Flint traveled a hundred miles a
2mo i, 1:day on the new steamer _Grecian_ "against the whole weight of the
2mo i, 1:Mississippi current." Three years later the round trip from Louisville
2mo i, 1:to New Orleans was cut to eight days. Heavy produce that once had to
2mo i, 1:float down to New Orleans could be carried upstream and sent to the East
2mo i, 1:by way of the canal systems.

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Thus the far country was brought near. The timid no longer hesitated at
2mo i, 1:the thought of the perilous journey. All routes were crowded with
2mo i, 1:Western immigrants. The forests fell before the ax like grain before the
2mo i, 1:sickle. Clearings scattered through the woods spread out into a great
2mo i, 1:mosaic of farms stretching from the Southern Appalachians to Lake
2mo i, 1:Michigan. The national census of 1830 gave 937,000 inhabitants to Ohio;
2mo i, 1:343,000 to Indiana; 157,000 to Illinois; 687,000 to Kentucky; and
2mo i, 1:681,000 to Tennessee.

2mo i, 1:With the increase in population and the growth of agriculture came
2mo i, 1:political influence. People who had once petitioned Congress now sent
2mo i, 1:their own representatives. Men who had hitherto accepted without
2mo i, 1:protests Presidents from the seaboard expressed a new spirit of dissent
2mo i, 1:in 1824 by giving only three electoral votes for John Quincy Adams; and
2mo i, 1:four years later they sent a son of the soil from Tennessee, Andrew
2mo i, 1:Jackson, to take Washington's chair as chief executive of the
2mo i, 1:nation--the first of a long line of Presidents from the Mississippi
2mo i, 1:basin.

2mo i, 1:JACKSONIAN DEMOCRACY
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The New England Federalists, at the Hartford convention, prophesied that
2mo i, 1:in time the West would dominate the East. "At the adoption of the
2mo i, 1:Constitution," they said, "a certain balance of power among the original
2mo i, 1:states was considered to exist, and there was at that time and yet is
2mo i, 1:among those parties a strong affinity between their great and general
2mo i, 1:interests. By the admission of these [new] states that balance has been
2mo i, 1:materially affected and unless the practice be modified must ultimately
2mo i, 1:be destroyed. The Southern states will first avail themselves of their
2mo i, 1:new confederates to govern the East, and finally the Western states,
2mo i, 1:multiplied in number, and augmented in population, will control the
2mo i, 1:interests of the whole." Strangely enough the fulfillment of this
2mo i, 1:prophecy was being prepared even in Federalist strongholds by the rise
2mo i, 1:of a new urban democracy that was to make common cause with the farmers
2mo i, 1:beyond the mountains.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT IN THE EAST
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Aristocratic Features of the Old Order.=--The Revolutionary
2mo i, 1:fathers, in setting up their first state constitutions, although they
2mo i, 1:often spoke of government as founded on the consent of the governed, did
2mo i, 1:not think that consistency required giving the vote to all adult males.
2mo i, 1:On the contrary they looked upon property owners as the only safe
2mo i, 1:"depositary" of political power. They went back to the colonial
2mo i, 1:tradition that related taxation and representation. This, they argued,
2mo i, 1:was not only just but a safeguard against the "excesses of democracy."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In carrying their theory into execution they placed taxpaying or
2mo i, 1:property qualifications on the right to vote. Broadly speaking, these
2mo i, 1:limitations fell into three classes. Three states, Pennsylvania (1776),
2mo i, 1:New Hampshire (1784), and Georgia (1798), gave the ballot to all who
2mo i, 1:paid taxes, without reference to the value of their property. Three,
2mo i, 1:Virginia, Delaware, and Rhode Island, clung firmly to the ancient
2mo i, 1:principles that only freeholders could be intrusted with electoral
2mo i, 1:rights. Still other states, while closely restricting the suffrage,
2mo i, 1:accepted the ownership of other things as well as land in fulfillment of
2mo i, 1:the requirements. In Massachusetts, for instance, the vote was granted
2mo i, 1:to all men who held land yielding an annual income of three pounds or
2mo i, 1:possessed other property worth sixty pounds.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The electors thus enfranchised, numerous as they were, owing to the wide
2mo i, 1:distribution of land, often suffered from a very onerous disability. In
2mo i, 1:many states they were able to vote only for persons of wealth because
2mo i, 1:heavy property qualifications were imposed on public officers. In New
2mo i, 1:Hampshire, the governor had to be worth five hundred pounds, one-half in
2mo i, 1:land; in Massachusetts, one thousand pounds, all freehold; in Maryland,
2mo i, 1:five thousand pounds, one thousand of which was freehold; in North
2mo i, 1:Carolina, one thousand pounds freehold; and in South Carolina, ten
2mo i, 1:thousand pounds freehold. A state senator in Massachusetts had to be the
2mo i, 1:owner of a freehold worth three hundred pounds or personal property
2mo i, 1:worth six hundred pounds; in New Jersey, one thousand pounds' worth of
2mo i, 1:property; in North Carolina, three hundred acres of land; in South
2mo i, 1:Carolina, two thousand pounds freehold. For members of the lower house
2mo i, 1:of the legislature lower qualifications were required.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In most of the states the suffrage or office holding or both were
2mo i, 1:further restricted by religious provisions. No single sect was powerful
2mo i, 1:enough to dominate after the Revolution, but, for the most part,
2mo i, 1:Catholics and Jews were either disfranchised or excluded from office.
2mo i, 1:North Carolina and Georgia denied the ballot to any one who was not a
2mo i, 1:Protestant. Delaware withheld it from all who did not believe in the
2mo i, 1:Trinity and the inspiration of the Scriptures. Massachusetts and
2mo i, 1:Maryland limited it to Christians. Virginia and New York, advanced for
2mo i, 1:their day, made no discrimination in government on account of religious
2mo i, 1:opinion.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Defense of the Old Order.=--It must not be supposed that property
2mo i, 1:qualifications were thoughtlessly imposed at the outset or considered of
2mo i, 1:little consequence in practice. In the beginning they were viewed as
2mo i, 1:fundamental. As towns grew in size and the number of landless citizens
2mo i, 1:increased, the restrictions were defended with even more vigor. In
2mo i, 1:Massachusetts, the great Webster upheld the rights of property in
2mo i, 1:government, saying: "It is entirely just that property should have its
2mo i, 1:due weight and consideration in political arrangements.... The
2mo i, 1:disastrous revolutions which the world has witnessed, those political
2mo i, 1:thunderstorms and earthquakes which have shaken the pillars of society
2mo i, 1:to their deepest foundations, have been revolutions against property."
2mo i, 1:In Pennsylvania, a leader in local affairs cried out against a plan to
2mo i, 1:remove the taxpaying limitation on the suffrage: "What does the delegate
2mo i, 1:propose? To place the vicious vagrant, the wandering Arabs, the Tartar
2mo i, 1:hordes of our large cities on the level with the virtuous and good man?"
2mo i, 1:In Virginia, Jefferson himself had first believed in property
2mo i, 1:qualifications and had feared with genuine alarm the "mobs of the great
2mo i, 1:cities." It was near the end of the eighteenth century before he
2mo i, 1:accepted the idea of manhood suffrage. Even then he was unable to
2mo i, 1:convince the constitution-makers of his own state. "It is not an idle
2mo i, 1:chimera of the brain," urged one of them, "that the possession of land
2mo i, 1:furnishes the strongest evidence of permanent, common interest with, and
2mo i, 1:attachment to, the community.... It is upon this foundation I wish to
2mo i, 1:place the right of suffrage. This is the best general standard which can
2mo i, 1:be resorted to for the purpose of determining whether the persons to be
2mo i, 1:invested with the right of suffrage are such persons as could be,
2mo i, 1:consistently with the safety and well-being of the community, intrusted
2mo i, 1:with the exercise of that right."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Attacks on the Restricted Suffrage.=--The changing circumstances of
2mo i, 1:American life, however, soon challenged the rule of those with property.
2mo i, 1:Prominent among the new forces were the rising mercantile and business
2mo i, 1:interests. Where the freehold qualification was applied, business men
2mo i, 1:who did not own land were deprived of the vote and excluded from office.
2mo i, 1:In New York, for example, the most illiterate farmer who had one hundred
2mo i, 1:pounds' worth of land could vote for state senator and governor, while
2mo i, 1:the landless banker or merchant could not. It is not surprising,
2mo i, 1:therefore, to find business men taking the lead in breaking down
2mo i, 1:freehold limitations on the suffrage. The professional classes also were
2mo i, 1:interested in removing the barriers which excluded many of them from
2mo i, 1:public affairs. It was a schoolmaster, Thomas Dorr, who led the popular
2mo i, 1:uprising in Rhode Island which brought the exclusive rule by freeholders
2mo i, 1:to an end.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In addition to the business and professional classes, the mechanics of
2mo i, 1:the towns showed a growing hostility to a system of government that
2mo i, 1:generally barred them from voting or holding office. Though not
2mo i, 1:numerous, they had early begun to exercise an influence on the course of
2mo i, 1:public affairs. They had led the riots against the Stamp Act, overturned
2mo i, 1:King George's statue, and "crammed stamps down the throats of
2mo i, 1:collectors." When the state constitutions were framed they took a lively
2mo i, 1:interest, particularly in New York City and Philadelphia. In June, 1776,
2mo i, 1:the "mechanicks in union" in New York protested against putting the new
2mo i, 1:state constitution into effect without their approval, declaring that
2mo i, 1:the right to vote on the acceptance or rejection of a fundamental law
2mo i, 1:"is the birthright of every man to whatever state he may belong." Though
2mo i, 1:their petition was rejected, their spirit remained. When, a few years
2mo i, 1:later, the federal Constitution was being framed, the mechanics watched
2mo i, 1:the process with deep concern; they knew that one of its main objects
2mo i, 1:was to promote trade and commerce, affecting directly their daily bread.
2mo i, 1:During the struggle over ratification, they passed resolutions approving
2mo i, 1:its provisions and they often joined in parades organized to stir up
2mo i, 1:sentiment for the Constitution, even though they could not vote for
2mo i, 1:members of the state conventions and so express their will directly.
2mo i, 1:After the organization of trade unions they collided with the courts of
2mo i, 1:law and thus became interested in the election of judges and lawmakers.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Those who attacked the old system of class rule found a strong moral
2mo i, 1:support in the Declaration of Independence. Was it not said that all men
2mo i, 1:are created equal? Whoever runs may read. Was it not declared that
2mo i, 1:governments derive their just power from the consent of the governed?
2mo i, 1:That doctrine was applied with effect to George III and seemed
2mo i, 1:appropriate for use against the privileged classes of Massachusetts or
2mo i, 1:Virginia. "How do the principles thus proclaimed," asked the
2mo i, 1:non-freeholders of Richmond, in petitioning for the ballot, "accord with
2mo i, 1:the existing regulation of the suffrage? A regulation which, instead of
2mo i, 1:the equality nature ordains, creates an odious distinction between
2mo i, 1:members of the same community ... and vests in a favored class, not in
2mo i, 1:consideration of their public services but of their private possessions,
2mo i, 1:the highest of all privileges."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Abolition of Property Qualifications.=--By many minor victories rather
2mo i, 1:than by any spectacular triumphs did the advocates of manhood suffrage
2mo i, 1:carry the day. Slight gains were made even during the Revolution or
2mo i, 1:shortly afterward. In Pennsylvania, the mechanics, by taking an active
2mo i, 1:part in the contest over the Constitution of 1776, were able to force
2mo i, 1:the qualification down to the payment of a small tax. Vermont came into
2mo i, 1:the union in 1792 without any property restrictions. In the same year
2mo i, 1:Delaware gave the vote to all men who paid taxes. Maryland, reckoned one
2mo i, 1:of the most conservative of states, embarked on the experiment of
2mo i, 1:manhood suffrage in 1809; and nine years later, Connecticut, equally
2mo i, 1:conservative, decided that all taxpayers were worthy of the ballot.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Five states, Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, Rhode Island, and North
2mo i, 1:Carolina, remained obdurate while these changes were going on around
2mo i, 1:them; finally they had to yield themselves. The last struggle in
2mo i, 1:Massachusetts took place in the constitutional convention of 1820. There
2mo i, 1:Webster, in the prime of his manhood, and John Adams, in the closing
2mo i, 1:years of his old age, alike protested against such radical innovations
2mo i, 1:as manhood suffrage. Their protests were futile. The property test was
2mo i, 1:abolished and a small tax-paying qualification was substituted. New York
2mo i, 1:surrendered the next year and, after trying some minor restrictions for
2mo i, 1:five years, went completely over to white manhood suffrage in 1826.
2mo i, 1:Rhode Island clung to her freehold qualification through thirty years of
2mo i, 1:agitation. Then Dorr's Rebellion, almost culminating in bloodshed,
2mo i, 1:brought about a reform in 1843 which introduced a slight tax-paying
2mo i, 1:qualification as an alternative to the freehold. Virginia and North
2mo i, 1:Carolina were still unconvinced. The former refused to abandon ownership
2mo i, 1:of land as the test for political rights until 1850 and the latter until
2mo i, 1:1856. Although religious discriminations and property qualifications for
2mo i, 1:office holders were sometimes retained after the establishment of
2mo i, 1:manhood suffrage, they were usually abolished along with the monopoly of
2mo i, 1:government enjoyed by property owners and taxpayers.

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:At the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth century, the white
2mo i, 1:male industrial workers and the mechanics of the Northern cities, at
2mo i, 1:least, could lay aside the petition for the ballot and enjoy with the
2mo i, 1:free farmer a voice in the government of their common country.
2mo i, 1:"Universal democracy," sighed Carlyle, who was widely read in the United
2mo i, 1:States, "whatever we may think of it has declared itself the inevitable
2mo i, 1:fact of the days in which we live; and he who has any chance to instruct
2mo i, 1:or lead in these days must begin by admitting that ... Where no
2mo i, 1:government is wanted, save that of the parish constable, as in America
2mo i, 1:with its boundless soil, every man being able to find work and
2mo i, 1:recompense for himself, democracy may subsist; not elsewhere." Amid the
2mo i, 1:grave misgivings of the first generation of statesmen, America was
2mo i, 1:committed to the great adventure, in the populous towns of the East as
2mo i, 1:well as in the forests and fields of the West.

2mo i, 1:THE NEW DEMOCRACY ENTERS THE ARENA
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The spirit of the new order soon had a pronounced effect on the
2mo i, 1:machinery of government and the practice of politics. The enfranchised
2mo i, 1:electors were not long in demanding for themselves a larger share in
2mo i, 1:administration.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Spoils System and Rotation in Office.=--First of all they wanted
2mo i, 1:office for themselves, regardless of their fitness. They therefore
2mo i, 1:extended the system of rewarding party workers with government
2mo i, 1:positions--a system early established in several states, notably New
2mo i, 1:York and Pennsylvania. Closely connected with it was the practice of
2mo i, 1:fixing short terms for officers and making frequent changes in
2mo i, 1:personnel. "Long continuance in office," explained a champion of this
2mo i, 1:idea in Pennsylvania in 1837, "unfits a man for the discharge of its
2mo i, 1:duties, by rendering him arbitrary and aristocratic, and tends to beget,
2mo i, 1:first life office, and then hereditary office, which leads to the
2mo i, 1:destruction of free government." The solution offered was the historic
2mo i, 1:doctrine of "rotation in office." At the same time the principle of
2mo i, 1:popular election was extended to an increasing number of officials who
2mo i, 1:had once been appointed either by the governor or the legislature. Even
2mo i, 1:geologists, veterinarians, surveyors, and other technical officers were
2mo i, 1:declared elective on the theory that their appointment "smacked of
2mo i, 1:monarchy."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Popular Election of Presidential Electors.=--In a short time the spirit
2mo i, 1:of democracy, while playing havoc with the old order in state
2mo i, 1:government, made its way upward into the federal system. The framers of
2mo i, 1:the Constitution, bewildered by many proposals and unable to agree on
2mo i, 1:any single plan, had committed the choice of presidential electors to
2mo i, 1:the discretion of the state legislatures. The legislatures, in turn,
2mo i, 1:greedy of power, early adopted the practice of choosing the electors
2mo i, 1:themselves; but they did not enjoy it long undisturbed. Democracy,
2mo i, 1:thundering at their doors, demanded that they surrender the privilege to
2mo i, 1:the people. Reluctantly they yielded, sometimes granting popular
2mo i, 1:election and then withdrawing it. The drift was inevitable, and the
2mo i, 1:climax came with the advent of Jacksonian democracy. In 1824, Vermont,
2mo i, 1:New York, Delaware, South Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana, though some
2mo i, 1:had experimented with popular election, still left the choice of
2mo i, 1:electors with the legislature. Eight years later South Carolina alone
2mo i, 1:held to the old practice. Popular election had become the final word.
2mo i, 1:The fanciful idea of an electoral college of "good and wise men,"
2mo i, 1:selected without passion or partisanship by state legislatures acting as
2mo i, 1:deliberative bodies, was exploded for all time; the election of the
2mo i, 1:nation's chief magistrate was committed to the tempestuous methods of
2mo i, 1:democracy.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Nominating Convention.=--As the suffrage was widened and the
2mo i, 1:popular choice of presidential electors extended, there arose a violent
2mo i, 1:protest against the methods used by the political parties in nominating
2mo i, 1:candidates. After the retirement of Washington, both the Republicans and
2mo i, 1:the Federalists found it necessary to agree upon their favorites before
2mo i, 1:the election, and they adopted a colonial device--the pre-election
2mo i, 1:caucus. The Federalist members of Congress held a conference and
2mo i, 1:selected their candidate, and the Republicans followed the example. In
2mo i, 1:a short time the practice of nominating by a "congressional caucus"
2mo i, 1:became a recognized institution. The election still remained with the
2mo i, 1:people; but the power of picking candidates for their approval passed
2mo i, 1:into the hands of a small body of Senators and Representatives.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:A reaction against this was unavoidable. To friends of "the plain
2mo i, 1:people," like Andrew Jackson, it was intolerable, all the more so
2mo i, 1:because the caucus never favored him with the nomination. More
2mo i, 1:conservative men also found grave objections to it. They pointed out
2mo i, 1:that, whereas the Constitution intended the President to be an
2mo i, 1:independent officer, he had now fallen under the control of a caucus of
2mo i, 1:congressmen. The supremacy of the legislative branch had been obtained
2mo i, 1:by an extra-legal political device. To such objections were added
2mo i, 1:practical considerations. In 1824, when personal rivalry had taken the
2mo i, 1:place of party conflicts, the congressional caucus selected as the
2mo i, 1:candidate, William H. Crawford, of Georgia, a man of distinction but no
2mo i, 1:great popularity, passing by such an obvious hero as General Jackson.
2mo i, 1:The followers of the General were enraged and demanded nothing short of
2mo i, 1:the death of "King Caucus." Their clamor was effective. Under their
2mo i, 1:attacks, the caucus came to an ignominious end.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In place of it there arose in 1831 a new device, the national nominating
2mo i, 1:convention, composed of delegates elected by party voters for the sole
2mo i, 1:purpose of nominating candidates. Senators and Representatives were
2mo i, 1:still prominent in the party councils, but they were swamped by hundreds
2mo i, 1:of delegates "fresh from the people," as Jackson was wont to say. In
2mo i, 1:fact, each convention was made up mainly of office holders and office
2mo i, 1:seekers, and the new institution was soon denounced as vigorously as
2mo i, 1:King Caucus had been, particularly by statesmen who failed to obtain a
2mo i, 1:nomination. Still it grew in strength and by 1840 was firmly
2mo i, 1:established.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The End of the Old Generation.=--In the election of 1824, the
2mo i, 1:representatives of the "aristocracy" made their last successful stand.
2mo i, 1:Until then the leadership by men of "wealth and talents" had been
2mo i, 1:undisputed. There had been five Presidents--Washington, John Adams,
2mo i, 1:Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe--all Eastern men brought up in prosperous
2mo i, 1:families with the advantages of culture which come from leisure and the
2mo i, 1:possession of life's refinements. None of them had ever been compelled
2mo i, 1:to work with his hands for a livelihood. Four of them had been
2mo i, 1:slaveholders. Jefferson was a philosopher, learned in natural science, a
2mo i, 1:master of foreign languages, a gentleman of dignity and grace of manner,
2mo i, 1:notwithstanding his studied simplicity. Madison, it was said, was armed
2mo i, 1:"with all the culture of his century." Monroe was a graduate of William
2mo i, 1:and Mary, a gentleman of the old school. Jefferson and his three
2mo i, 1:successors called themselves Republicans and professed a genuine faith
2mo i, 1:in the people but they were not "of the people" themselves; they were
2mo i, 1:not sons of the soil or the workshop. They were all men of "the grand
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:old order of society" who gave finish and style even to popular
2mo i, 1:government.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Monroe was the last of the Presidents belonging to the heroic epoch of
2mo i, 1:the Revolution. He had served in the war for independence, in the
2mo i, 1:Congress under the Articles of Confederation, and in official capacity
2mo i, 1:after the adoption of the Constitution. In short, he was of the age that
2mo i, 1:had wrought American independence and set the government afloat. With
2mo i, 1:his passing, leadership went to a new generation; but his successor,
2mo i, 1:John Quincy Adams, formed a bridge between the old and the new in that
2mo i, 1:he combined a high degree of culture with democratic sympathies.
2mo i, 1:Washington had died in 1799, preceded but a few months by Patrick Henry
2mo i, 1:and followed in four years by Samuel Adams. Hamilton had been killed in
2mo i, 1:a duel with Burr in 1804. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were yet alive
2mo i, 1:in 1824 but they were soon to pass from the scene, reconciled at last,
2mo i, 1:full of years and honors. Madison was in dignified retirement, destined
2mo i, 1:to live long enough to protest against the doctrine of nullification
2mo i, 1:proclaimed by South Carolina before death carried him away at the ripe
2mo i, 1:old age of eighty-five.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Election of John Quincy Adams (1824).=--The campaign of 1824 marked
2mo i, 1:the end of the "era of good feeling" inaugurated by the collapse of the
2mo i, 1:Federalist party after the election of 1816. There were four leading
2mo i, 1:candidates, John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, and W.H.
2mo i, 1:Crawford. The result of the election was a division of the electoral
2mo i, 1:votes into four parts and no one received a majority. Under the
2mo i, 1:Constitution, therefore, the selection of President passed to the House
2mo i, 1:of Representatives. Clay, who stood at the bottom of the poll, threw his
2mo i, 1:weight to Adams and assured his triumph, much to the chagrin of
2mo i, 1:Jackson's friends. They thought, with a certain justification, that
2mo i, 1:inasmuch as the hero of New Orleans had received the largest electoral
2mo i, 1:vote, the House was morally bound to accept the popular judgment and
2mo i, 1:make him President. Jackson shook hands cordially with Adams on the day
2mo i, 1:of the inauguration, but never forgave him for being elected.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:While Adams called himself a Republican in politics and often spoke of
2mo i, 1:"the rule of the people," he was regarded by Jackson's followers as "an
2mo i, 1:aristocrat." He was not a son of the soil. Neither was he acquainted at
2mo i, 1:first hand with the labor of farmers and mechanics. He had been educated
2mo i, 1:at Harvard and in Europe. Like his illustrious father, John Adams, he
2mo i, 1:was a stern and reserved man, little given to seeking popularity.
2mo i, 1:Moreover, he was from the East and the frontiersmen of the West regarded
2mo i, 1:him as a man "born with a silver spoon in his mouth." Jackson's
2mo i, 1:supporters especially disliked him because they thought their hero
2mo i, 1:entitled to the presidency. Their anger was deepened when Adams
2mo i, 1:appointed Clay to the office of Secretary of State; and they set up a
2mo i, 1:cry that there had been a "deal" by which Clay had helped to elect Adams
2mo i, 1:to get office for himself.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Though Adams conducted his administration with great dignity and in a
2mo i, 1:fine spirit of public service, he was unable to overcome the opposition
2mo i, 1:which he encountered on his election to office or to win popularity in
2mo i, 1:the West and South. On the contrary, by advocating government assistance
2mo i, 1:in building roads and canals and public grants in aid of education,
2mo i, 1:arts, and sciences, he ran counter to the current which had set in
2mo i, 1:against appropriations of federal funds for internal improvements. By
2mo i, 1:signing the Tariff Bill of 1828, soon known as the "Tariff of
2mo i, 1:Abominations," he made new enemies without adding to his friends in New
2mo i, 1:York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio where he sorely needed them. Handicapped by
2mo i, 1:the false charge that he had been a party to a "corrupt bargain" with
2mo i, 1:Clay to secure his first election; attacked for his advocacy of a high
2mo i, 1:protective tariff; charged with favoring an "aristocracy of
2mo i, 1:office-holders" in Washington on account of his refusal to discharge
2mo i, 1:government clerks by the wholesale, Adams was retired from the White
2mo i, 1:House after he had served four years.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Triumph of Jackson in 1828.=--Probably no candidate for the
2mo i, 1:presidency ever had such passionate popular support as Andrew Jackson
2mo i, 1:had in 1828. He was truly a man of the people. Born of poor parents in
2mo i, 1:the upland region of South Carolina, schooled in poverty and adversity,
2mo i, 1:without the advantages of education or the refinements of cultivated
2mo i, 1:leisure, he seemed the embodiment of the spirit of the new American
2mo i, 1:democracy. Early in his youth he had gone into the frontier of Tennessee
2mo i, 1:where he soon won a name as a fearless and intrepid Indian fighter. On
2mo i, 1:the march and in camp, he endeared himself to his men by sharing their
2mo i, 1:hardships, sleeping on the ground with them, and eating parched corn
2mo i, 1:when nothing better could be found for the privates. From local
2mo i, 1:prominence he sprang into national fame by his exploit at the battle of
2mo i, 1:New Orleans. His reputation as a military hero was enhanced by the
2mo i, 1:feeling that he had been a martyr to political treachery in 1824. The
2mo i, 1:farmers of the West and South claimed him as their own. The mechanics of
2mo i, 1:the Eastern cities, newly enfranchised, also looked upon him as their
2mo i, 1:friend. Though his views on the tariff, internal improvements, and other
2mo i, 1:issues before the country were either vague or unknown, he was readily
2mo i, 1:elected President.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The returns of the electoral vote in 1828 revealed the sources of
2mo i, 1:Jackson's power. In New England, he received but one ballot, from
2mo i, 1:Maine; he had a majority of the electors in New York and all of them in
2mo i, 1:Pennsylvania; and he carried every state south of Maryland and beyond
2mo i, 1:the Appalachians. Adams did not get a single electoral vote in the South
2mo i, 1:and West. The prophecy of the Hartford convention had been fulfilled.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: ANDREW JACKSON]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:When Jackson took the oath of office on March 4, 1829, the government of
2mo i, 1:the United States entered into a new era. Until this time the
2mo i, 1:inauguration of a President--even that of Jefferson, the apostle of
2mo i, 1:simplicity--had brought no rude shock to the course of affairs at the
2mo i, 1:capital. Hitherto the installation of a President meant that an
2mo i, 1:old-fashioned gentleman, accompanied by a few servants, had driven to
2mo i, 1:the White House in his own coach, taken the oath with quiet dignity,
2mo i, 1:appointed a few new men to the higher posts, continued in office the
2mo i, 1:long list of regular civil employees, and begun his administration with
2mo i, 1:respectable decorum. Jackson changed all this. When he was inaugurated,
2mo i, 1:men and women journeyed hundreds of miles to witness the ceremony. Great
2mo i, 1:throngs pressed into the White House, "upset the bowls of punch, broke
2mo i, 1:the glasses, and stood with their muddy boots on the satin-covered
2mo i, 1:chairs to see the people's President." If Jefferson's inauguration was,
2mo i, 1:as he called it, the "great revolution," Jackson's inauguration was a
2mo i, 1:cataclysm.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE NEW DEMOCRACY AT WASHINGTON
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Spoils System.=--The staid and respectable society of Washington
2mo i, 1:was disturbed by this influx of farmers and frontiersmen. To speak of
2mo i, 1:politics became "bad form" among fashionable women. The clerks and
2mo i, 1:civil servants of the government who had enjoyed long and secure tenure
2mo i, 1:of office became alarmed at the clamor of new men for their positions.
2mo i, 1:Doubtless the major portion of them had opposed the election of Jackson
2mo i, 1:and looked with feelings akin to contempt upon him and his followers.
2mo i, 1:With a hunter's instinct, Jackson scented his prey. Determined to have
2mo i, 1:none but his friends in office, he made a clean sweep, expelling old
2mo i, 1:employees to make room for men "fresh from the people." This was a new
2mo i, 1:custom. Other Presidents had discharged a few officers for engaging in
2mo i, 1:opposition politics. They had been careful in making appointments not to
2mo i, 1:choose inveterate enemies; but they discharged relatively few men on
2mo i, 1:account of their political views and partisan activities.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:By wholesale removals and the frank selection of officers on party
2mo i, 1:grounds--a practice already well intrenched in New York--Jackson
2mo i, 1:established the "spoils system" at Washington. The famous slogan, "to
2mo i, 1:the victor belong the spoils of victory," became the avowed principle of
2mo i, 1:the national government. Statesmen like Calhoun denounced it; poets like
2mo i, 1:James Russell Lowell ridiculed it; faithful servants of the government
2mo i, 1:suffered under it; but it held undisturbed sway for half a century
2mo i, 1:thereafter, each succeeding generation outdoing, if possible, its
2mo i, 1:predecessor in the use of public office for political purposes. If any
2mo i, 1:one remarked that training and experience were necessary qualifications
2mo i, 1:for important public positions, he met Jackson's own profession of
2mo i, 1:faith: "The duties of any public office are so simple or admit of being
2mo i, 1:made so simple that any man can in a short time become master of them."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Tariff and Nullification.=--Jackson had not been installed in power
2mo i, 1:very long before he was compelled to choose between states' rights and
2mo i, 1:nationalism. The immediate occasion of the trouble was the tariff--a
2mo i, 1:matter on which Jackson did not have any very decided views. His mind
2mo i, 1:did not run naturally to abstruse economic questions; and owing to the
2mo i, 1:divided opinion of the country it was "good politics" to be vague and
2mo i, 1:ambiguous in the controversy. Especially was this true, because the
2mo i, 1:tariff issue was threatening to split the country into parties again.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_The Development of the Policy of "Protection."_--The war of 1812 and
2mo i, 1:the commercial policies of England which followed it had accentuated the
2mo i, 1:need for American economic independence. During that conflict, the
2mo i, 1:United States, cut off from English manufactures as during the
2mo i, 1:Revolution, built up home industries to meet the unusual call for iron,
2mo i, 1:steel, cloth, and other military and naval supplies as well as the
2mo i, 1:demands from ordinary markets. Iron foundries and textile mills sprang
2mo i, 1:up as in the night; hundreds of business men invested fortunes in
2mo i, 1:industrial enterprises so essential to the military needs of the
2mo i, 1:government; and the people at large fell into the habit of buying
2mo i, 1:American-made goods again. As the London _Times_ tersely observed of the
2mo i, 1:Americans, "their first war with England made them independent; their
2mo i, 1:second war made them formidable."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In recognition of this state of affairs, the tariff of 1816 was
2mo i, 1:designed: _first_, to prevent England from ruining these "infant
2mo i, 1:industries" by dumping the accumulated stores of years suddenly upon
2mo i, 1:American markets; and, _secondly_, to enlarge in the manufacturing
2mo i, 1:centers the demand for American agricultural produce. It accomplished
2mo i, 1:the purposes of its framers. It kept in operation the mills and furnaces
2mo i, 1:so recently built. It multiplied the number of industrial workers and
2mo i, 1:enhanced the demand for the produce of the soil. It brought about
2mo i, 1:another very important result. It turned the capital and enterprise of
2mo i, 1:New England from shipping to manufacturing, and converted her statesmen,
2mo i, 1:once friends of low tariffs, into ardent advocates of protection.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In the early years of the nineteenth century, the Yankees had bent their
2mo i, 1:energies toward building and operating ships to carry produce from
2mo i, 1:America to Europe and manufactures from Europe to America. For this
2mo i, 1:reason, they had opposed the tariff of 1816 calculated to increase
2mo i, 1:domestic production and cut down the carrying trade. Defeated in their
2mo i, 1:efforts, they accepted the inevitable and turned to manufacturing. Soon
2mo i, 1:they were powerful friends of protection for American enterprise. As the
2mo i, 1:money invested and the labor employed in the favored industries
2mo i, 1:increased, the demand for continued and heavier protection grew apace.
2mo i, 1:Even the farmers who furnished raw materials, like wool, flax, and hemp,
2mo i, 1:began to see eye to eye with the manufacturers. So the textile interests
2mo i, 1:of New England, the iron masters of Connecticut, New Jersey, and
2mo i, 1:Pennsylvania, the wool, hemp, and flax growers of Ohio, Kentucky, and
2mo i, 1:Tennessee, and the sugar planters of Louisiana developed into a
2mo i, 1:formidable combination in support of a high protective tariff.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_The Planting States Oppose the Tariff._--In the meantime, the cotton
2mo i, 1:states on the seaboard had forgotten about the havoc wrought during the
2mo i, 1:Napoleonic wars when their produce rotted because there were no ships to
2mo i, 1:carry it to Europe. The seas were now open. The area devoted to cotton
2mo i, 1:had swiftly expanded as Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana were opened
2mo i, 1:up. Cotton had in fact become "king" and the planters depended for their
2mo i, 1:prosperity, as they thought, upon the sale of their staple to English
2mo i, 1:manufacturers whose spinning and weaving mills were the wonder of the
2mo i, 1:world. Manufacturing nothing and having to buy nearly everything except
2mo i, 1:farm produce and even much of that for slaves, the planters naturally
2mo i, 1:wanted to purchase manufactures in the cheapest market, England, where
2mo i, 1:they sold most of their cotton. The tariff, they contended, raised the
2mo i, 1:price of the goods they had to buy and was thus in fact a tribute laid
2mo i, 1:on them for the benefit of the Northern mill owners.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_The Tariff of Abominations._--They were overborne, however, in 1824 and
2mo i, 1:again in 1828 when Northern manufacturers and Western farmers forced
2mo i, 1:Congress to make an upward revision of the tariff. The Act of 1828 known
2mo i, 1:as "the Tariff of Abominations," though slightly modified in 1832, was
2mo i, 1:"the straw which broke the camel's back." Southern leaders turned in
2mo i, 1:rage against the whole system. The legislatures of Virginia, North
2mo i, 1:Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama denounced it; a general
2mo i, 1:convention of delegates held at Augusta issued a protest of defiance
2mo i, 1:against it; and South Carolina, weary of verbal battles, decided to
2mo i, 1:prevent its enforcement.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_South Carolina Nullifies the Tariff._--The legislature of that state,
2mo i, 1:on October 26, 1832, passed a bill calling for a state convention which
2mo i, 1:duly assembled in the following month. In no mood for compromise, it
2mo i, 1:adopted the famous Ordinance of Nullification after a few days' debate.
2mo i, 1:Every line of this document was clear and firm. The tariff, it opened,
2mo i, 1:gives "bounties to classes and individuals ... at the expense and to the
2mo i, 1:injury and oppression of other classes and individuals"; it is a
2mo i, 1:violation of the Constitution of the United States and therefore null
2mo i, 1:and void; its enforcement in South Carolina is unlawful; if the federal
2mo i, 1:government attempts to coerce the state into obeying the law, "the
2mo i, 1:people of this state will thenceforth hold themselves absolved from all
2mo i, 1:further obligations to maintain or preserve their political connection
2mo i, 1:with the people of the other states and will forthwith proceed to
2mo i, 1:organize a separate government and do all other acts and things which
2mo i, 1:sovereign and independent states may of right do."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_Southern States Condemn Nullification._--The answer of the country to
2mo i, 1:this note of defiance, couched in the language used in the Kentucky
2mo i, 1:resolutions and by the New England Federalists during the war of 1812,
2mo i, 1:was quick and positive. The legislatures of the Southern states, while
2mo i, 1:condemning the tariff, repudiated the step which South Carolina had
2mo i, 1:taken. Georgia responded: "We abhor the doctrine of nullification as
2mo i, 1:neither a peaceful nor a constitutional remedy." Alabama found it
2mo i, 1:"unsound in theory and dangerous in practice." North Carolina replied
2mo i, 1:that it was "revolutionary in character, subversive of the Constitution
2mo i, 1:of the United States." Mississippi answered: "It is disunion by
2mo i, 1:force--it is civil war." Virginia spoke more softly, condemning the
2mo i, 1:tariff and sustaining the principle of the Virginia resolutions but
2mo i, 1:denying that South Carolina could find in them any sanction for her
2mo i, 1:proceedings.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_Jackson Firmly Upholds the Union._--The eyes of the country were turned
2mo i, 1:upon Andrew Jackson. It was known that he looked with no friendly
2mo i, 1:feelings upon nullification, for, at a Jefferson dinner in the spring of
2mo i, 1:1830 while the subject was in the air, he had with laconic firmness
2mo i, 1:announced a toast: "Our federal union; it must be preserved." When two
2mo i, 1:years later the open challenge came from South Carolina, he replied that
2mo i, 1:he would enforce the law, saying with his frontier directness: "If a
2mo i, 1:single drop of blood shall be shed there in opposition to the laws of
2mo i, 1:the United States, I will hang the first man I can lay my hands on
2mo i, 1:engaged in such conduct upon the first tree that I can reach." He made
2mo i, 1:ready to keep his word by preparing for the use of military and naval
2mo i, 1:forces in sustaining the authority of the federal government. Then in a
2mo i, 1:long and impassioned proclamation to the people of South Carolina he
2mo i, 1:pointed out the national character of the union, and announced his
2mo i, 1:solemn resolve to preserve it by all constitutional means. Nullification
2mo i, 1:he branded as "incompatible with the existence of the union,
2mo i, 1:contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized
2mo i, 1:by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was
2mo i, 1:founded, and destructive of the great objects for which it was formed."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_A Compromise._--In his messages to Congress, however, Jackson spoke the
2mo i, 1:language of conciliation. A few days before issuing his proclamation he
2mo i, 1:suggested that protection should be limited to the articles of domestic
2mo i, 1:manufacture indispensable to safety in war time, and shortly afterward
2mo i, 1:he asked for new legislation to aid him in enforcing the laws. With two
2mo i, 1:propositions before it, one to remove the chief grounds for South
2mo i, 1:Carolina's resistance and the other to apply force if it was continued,
2mo i, 1:Congress bent its efforts to avoid a crisis. On February 12, 1833,
2mo i, 1:Henry Clay laid before the Senate a compromise tariff bill providing for
2mo i, 1:the gradual reduction of the duties until by 1842 they would reach the
2mo i, 1:level of the law which Calhoun had supported in 1816. About the same
2mo i, 1:time the "force bill," designed to give the President ample authority in
2mo i, 1:executing the law in South Carolina, was taken up. After a short but
2mo i, 1:acrimonious debate, both measures were passed and signed by President
2mo i, 1:Jackson on the same day, March 2. Looking upon the reduction of the
2mo i, 1:tariff as a complete vindication of her policy and an undoubted victory,
2mo i, 1:South Carolina rescinded her ordinance and enacted another nullifying
2mo i, 1:the force bill.

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_The Webster-Hayne Debate._--Where the actual victory lay in this
2mo i, 1:quarrel, long the subject of high dispute, need not concern us to-day.
2mo i, 1:Perhaps the chief result of the whole affair was a clarification of the
2mo i, 1:issue between the North and the South--a definite statement of the
2mo i, 1:principles for which men on both sides were years afterward to lay down
2mo i, 1:their lives. On behalf of nationalism and a perpetual union, the stanch
2mo i, 1:old Democrat from Tennessee had, in his proclamation on nullification,
2mo i, 1:spoken a language that admitted of only one meaning. On behalf of
2mo i, 1:nullification, Senator Hayne, of South Carolina, a skilled lawyer and
2mo i, 1:courtly orator, had in a great speech delivered in the Senate in
2mo i, 1:January, 1830, set forth clearly and cogently the doctrine that the
2mo i, 1:union is a compact among sovereign states from which the parties may
2mo i, 1:lawfully withdraw. It was this address that called into the arena
2mo i, 1:Daniel Webster, Senator from Massachusetts, who, spreading the mantle
2mo i, 1:of oblivion over the Hartford convention, delivered a reply to Hayne
2mo i, 1:that has been reckoned among the powerful orations of all time--a plea
2mo i, 1:for the supremacy of the Constitution and the national character of the
2mo i, 1:union.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The War on the United States Bank.=--If events forced the issue of
2mo i, 1:nationalism and nullification upon Jackson, the same could not be said
2mo i, 1:of his attack on the bank. That institution, once denounced by every
2mo i, 1:true Jeffersonian, had been reestablished in 1816 under the
2mo i, 1:administration of Jefferson's disciple, James Madison. It had not been
2mo i, 1:in operation very long, however, before it aroused bitter opposition,
2mo i, 1:especially in the South and the West. Its notes drove out of circulation
2mo i, 1:the paper currency of unsound banks chartered by the states, to the
2mo i, 1:great anger of local financiers. It was accused of favoritism in making
2mo i, 1:loans, of conferring special privileges upon politicians in return for
2mo i, 1:their support at Washington. To all Jackson's followers it was "an
2mo i, 1:insidious money power." One of them openly denounced it as an
2mo i, 1:institution designed "to strengthen the arm of wealth and counterpoise
2mo i, 1:the influence of extended suffrage in the disposition of public
2mo i, 1:affairs."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:This sentiment President Jackson fully shared. In his first message to
2mo i, 1:Congress he assailed the bank in vigorous language. He declared that its
2mo i, 1:constitutionality was in doubt and alleged that it had failed to
2mo i, 1:establish a sound and uniform currency. If such an institution was
2mo i, 1:necessary, he continued, it should be a public bank, owned and managed
2mo i, 1:by the government, not a private concern endowed with special privileges
2mo i, 1:by it. In his second and third messages, Jackson came back to the
2mo i, 1:subject, leaving the decision, however, to "an enlightened people and
2mo i, 1:their representatives."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Moved by this frank hostility and anxious for the future, the bank
2mo i, 1:applied to Congress for a renewal of its charter in 1832, four years
2mo i, 1:before the expiration of its life. Clay, with his eye upon the
2mo i, 1:presidency and an issue for the campaign, warmly supported the
2mo i, 1:application. Congress, deeply impressed by his leadership, passed the
2mo i, 1:bill granting the new charter, and sent the open defiance to Jackson.
2mo i, 1:His response was an instant veto. The battle was on and it raged with
2mo i, 1:fury until the close of his second administration, ending in the
2mo i, 1:destruction of the bank, a disordered currency, and a national panic.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In his veto message, Jackson attacked the bank as unconstitutional and
2mo i, 1:even hinted at corruption. He refused to assent to the proposition that
2mo i, 1:the Supreme Court had settled the question of constitutionality by the
2mo i, 1:decision in the McCulloch case. "Each public officer," he argued, "who
2mo i, 1:takes an oath to support the Constitution, swears that he will support
2mo i, 1:it as he understands it, not as it is understood by others."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Not satisfied with his veto and his declaration against the bank,
2mo i, 1:Jackson ordered the Secretary of the Treasury to withdraw the government
2mo i, 1:deposits which formed a large part of the institution's funds. This
2mo i, 1:action he followed up by an open charge that the bank had used money
2mo i, 1:shamefully to secure the return of its supporters to Congress. The
2mo i, 1:Senate, stung by this charge, solemnly resolved that Jackson had
2mo i, 1:"assumed upon himself authority and power not conferred by the
2mo i, 1:Constitution and laws, but in derogation of both."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The effects of the destruction of the bank were widespread. When its
2mo i, 1:charter expired in 1836, banking was once more committed to the control
2mo i, 1:of the states. The state legislatures, under a decision rendered by the
2mo i, 1:Supreme Court after the death of Marshall, began to charter banks under
2mo i, 1:state ownership and control, with full power to issue paper money--this
2mo i, 1:in spite of the provision in the Constitution that states shall not
2mo i, 1:issue bills of credit or make anything but gold and silver coin legal
2mo i, 1:tender in the payment of debts. Once more the country was flooded by
2mo i, 1:paper currency of uncertain value. To make matters worse, Jackson
2mo i, 1:adopted the practice of depositing huge amounts of government funds in
2mo i, 1:these banks, not forgetting to render favors to those institutions which
2mo i, 1:supported him in politics--"pet banks," as they were styled at the
2mo i, 1:time. In 1837, partially, though by no means entirely, as a result of
2mo i, 1:the abolition of the bank, the country was plunged into one of the most
2mo i, 1:disastrous panics which it ever experienced.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Internal Improvements Checked.=--The bank had presented to Jackson a
2mo i, 1:very clear problem--one of destruction. Other questions were not so
2mo i, 1:simple, particularly the subject of federal appropriations in aid of
2mo i, 1:roads and other internal improvements. Jefferson had strongly favored
2mo i, 1:government assistance in such matters, but his administration was
2mo i, 1:followed by a reaction. Both Madison and Monroe vetoed acts of Congress
2mo i, 1:appropriating public funds for public roads, advancing as their reason
2mo i, 1:the argument that the Constitution authorized no such laws. Jackson,
2mo i, 1:puzzled by the clamor on both sides, followed their example without
2mo i, 1:making the constitutional bar absolute. Congress, he thought, might
2mo i, 1:lawfully build highways of a national and military value, but he
2mo i, 1:strongly deprecated attacks by local interests on the federal treasury.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Triumph of the Executive Branch.=--Jackson's reelection in 1832
2mo i, 1:served to confirm his opinion that he was the chosen leader of the
2mo i, 1:people, freed and instructed to ride rough shod over Congress and even
2mo i, 1:the courts. No President before or since ever entertained in times of
2mo i, 1:peace such lofty notions of executive prerogative. The entire body of
2mo i, 1:federal employees he transformed into obedient servants of his wishes, a
2mo i, 1:sign or a nod from him making and undoing the fortunes of the humble and
2mo i, 1:the mighty. His lawful cabinet of advisers, filling all of the high
2mo i, 1:posts in the government, he treated with scant courtesy, preferring
2mo i, 1:rather to secure his counsel and advice from an unofficial body of
2mo i, 1:friends and dependents who, owing to their secret methods and back
2mo i, 1:stairs arrangements, became known as "the kitchen cabinet." Under the
2mo i, 1:leadership of a silent, astute, and resourceful politician, Amos
2mo i, 1:Kendall, this informal gathering of the faithful both gave and carried
2mo i, 1:out decrees and orders, communicating the President's lightest wish or
2mo i, 1:strictest command to the uttermost part of the country. Resolutely and
2mo i, 1:in the face of bitter opposition Jackson had removed the deposits from
2mo i, 1:the United States Bank. When the Senate protested against this arbitrary
2mo i, 1:conduct, he did not rest until it was forced to expunge the resolution
2mo i, 1:of condemnation; in time one of his lieutenants with his own hands was
2mo i, 1:able to tear the censure from the records. When Chief Justice Marshall
2mo i, 1:issued a decree against Georgia which did not suit him, Jackson,
2mo i, 1:according to tradition, blurted out that Marshall could go ahead and
2mo i, 1:enforce his own orders. To the end he pursued his willful way, finally
2mo i, 1:even choosing his own successor.

2mo i, 1:THE RISE OF THE WHIGS
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Jackson's Measures Arouse Opposition.=--Measures so decided, policies
2mo i, 1:so radical, and conduct so high-handed could not fail to arouse against
2mo i, 1:Jackson a deep and exasperated opposition. The truth is the conduct of
2mo i, 1:his entire administration profoundly disturbed the business and finances
2mo i, 1:of the country. It was accompanied by conditions similar to those which
2mo i, 1:existed under the Articles of Confederation. A paper currency, almost as
2mo i, 1:unstable and irritating as the worthless notes of revolutionary days,
2mo i, 1:flooded the country, hindering the easy transaction of business. The use
2mo i, 1:of federal funds for internal improvements, so vital to the exchange of
2mo i, 1:commodities which is the very life of industry, was blocked by executive
2mo i, 1:vetoes. The Supreme Court, which, under Marshall, had held refractory
2mo i, 1:states to their obligations under the Constitution, was flouted; states'
2mo i, 1:rights judges, deliberately selected by Jackson for the bench, began to
2mo i, 1:sap and undermine the rulings of Marshall. The protective tariff, under
2mo i, 1:which the textile industry of New England, the iron mills of
2mo i, 1:Pennsylvania, and the wool, flax, and hemp farms of the West had
2mo i, 1:flourished, had received a severe blow in the compromise of 1833 which
2mo i, 1:promised a steady reduction of duties. To cap the climax, Jackson's
2mo i, 1:party, casting aside the old and reputable name of Republican, boldly
2mo i, 1:chose for its title the term "Democrat," throwing down the gauntlet to
2mo i, 1:every conservative who doubted the omniscience of the people. All these
2mo i, 1:things worked together to evoke an opposition that was sharp and
2mo i, 1:determined.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: AN OLD CARTOON RIDICULING CLAY'S TARIFF AND INTERNAL
2mo i, 1:IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Clay and the National Republicans.=--In this opposition movement,
2mo i, 1:leadership fell to Henry Clay, a son of Kentucky, rather than to Daniel
2mo i, 1:Webster of Massachusetts. Like Jackson, Clay was born in a home haunted
2mo i, 1:by poverty. Left fatherless early and thrown upon his own resources, he
2mo i, 1:went from Virginia into Kentucky where by sheer force of intellect he
2mo i, 1:rose to eminence in the profession of law. Without the martial gifts or
2mo i, 1:the martial spirit of Jackson, he slipped more easily into the social
2mo i, 1:habits of the East at the same time that he retained his hold on the
2mo i, 1:affections of the boisterous West. Farmers of Ohio, Indiana, and
2mo i, 1:Kentucky loved him; financiers of New York and Philadelphia trusted him.
2mo i, 1:He was thus a leader well fitted to gather the forces of opposition
2mo i, 1:into union against Jackson.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Around Clay's standard assembled a motley collection, representing every
2mo i, 1:species of political opinion, united by one tie only--hatred for "Old
2mo i, 1:Hickory." Nullifiers and less strenuous advocates of states' rights were
2mo i, 1:yoked with nationalists of Webster's school; ardent protectionists were
2mo i, 1:bound together with equally ardent free traders, all fraternizing in one
2mo i, 1:grand confusion of ideas under the title of "National Republicans." Thus
2mo i, 1:the ancient and honorable term selected by Jefferson and his party, now
2mo i, 1:abandoned by Jacksonian Democracy, was adroitly adopted to cover the
2mo i, 1:supporters of Clay. The platform of the party, however, embraced all the
2mo i, 1:old Federalist principles: protection for American industry; internal
2mo i, 1:improvements; respect for the Supreme Court; resistance to executive
2mo i, 1:tyranny; and denunciation of the spoils system. Though Jackson was
2mo i, 1:easily victorious in 1832, the popular vote cast for Clay should have
2mo i, 1:given him some doubts about the faith of "the whole people" in the
2mo i, 1:wisdom of his "reign."
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Van Buren and the Panic of 1837.=--Nothing could shake the General's
2mo i, 1:superb confidence. At the end of his second term he insisted on
2mo i, 1:selecting his own successor; at a national convention, chosen by party
2mo i, 1:voters, but packed with his office holders and friends, he nominated
2mo i, 1:Martin Van Buren of New York. Once more he proved his strength by
2mo i, 1:carrying the country for the Democrats. With a fine flourish, he
2mo i, 1:attended the inauguration of Van Buren and then retired, amid the
2mo i, 1:applause and tears of his devotees, to the Hermitage, his home in
2mo i, 1:Tennessee.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Fortunately for him, Jackson escaped the odium of a disastrous panic
2mo i, 1:which struck the country with terrible force in the following summer.
2mo i, 1:Among the contributory causes of this crisis, no doubt, were the
2mo i, 1:destruction of the bank and the issuance of the "specie circular" of
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:1836 which required the purchasers of public lands to pay for them in
2mo i, 1:coin, instead of the paper notes of state banks. Whatever the dominating
2mo i, 1:cause, the ruin was widespread. Bank after bank went under; boom towns
2mo i, 1:in the West collapsed; Eastern mills shut down; and working people in
2mo i, 1:the industrial centers, starving from unemployment, begged for relief.
2mo i, 1:Van Buren braved the storm, offering no measure of reform or assistance
2mo i, 1:to the distracted people. He did seek security for government funds by
2mo i, 1:suggesting the removal of deposits from private banks and the
2mo i, 1:establishment of an independent treasury system, with government
2mo i, 1:depositaries for public funds, in several leading cities. This plan was
2mo i, 1:finally accepted by Congress in 1840.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Had Van Buren been a captivating figure he might have lived down the
2mo i, 1:discredit of the panic unjustly laid at his door; but he was far from
2mo i, 1:being a favorite with the populace. Though a man of many talents, he
2mo i, 1:owed his position to the quiet and adept management of Jackson rather
2mo i, 1:than to his own personal qualities. The men of the frontier did not care
2mo i, 1:for him. They suspected that he ate from "gold plate" and they could not
2mo i, 1:forgive him for being an astute politician from New York. Still the
2mo i, 1:Democratic party, remembering Jackson's wishes, renominated him
2mo i, 1:unanimously in 1840 and saw him go down to utter defeat.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Whigs and General Harrison.=--By this time, the National
2mo i, 1:Republicans, now known as Whigs--a title taken from the party of
2mo i, 1:opposition to the Crown in England, had learned many lessons. Taking a
2mo i, 1:leaf out of the Democratic book, they nominated, not Clay of Kentucky,
2mo i, 1:well known for his views on the bank, the tariff, and internal
2mo i, 1:improvements, but a military hero, General William Henry Harrison, a man
2mo i, 1:of uncertain political opinions. Harrison, a son of a Virginia signer of
2mo i, 1:the Declaration of Independence, sprang into public view by winning a
2mo i, 1:battle more famous than important, "Tippecanoe"--a brush with the
2mo i, 1:Indians in Indiana. He added to his laurels by rendering praiseworthy
2mo i, 1:services during the war of 1812. When days of peace returned he was
2mo i, 1:rewarded by a grateful people with a seat in Congress. Then he retired
2mo i, 1:to quiet life in a little village near Cincinnati. Like Jackson he was
2mo i, 1:held to be a son of the South and the West. Like Jackson he was a
2mo i, 1:military hero, a lesser light, but still a light. Like Old Hickory he
2mo i, 1:rode into office on a tide of popular feeling against an Eastern man
2mo i, 1:accused of being something of an aristocrat. His personal popularity was
2mo i, 1:sufficient. The Whigs who nominated him shrewdly refused to adopt a
2mo i, 1:platform or declare their belief in anything. When some Democrat
2mo i, 1:asserted that Harrison was a backwoodsman whose sole wants were a jug of
2mo i, 1:hard cider and a log cabin, the Whigs treated the remark not as an
2mo i, 1:insult but as proof positive that Harrison deserved the votes of Jackson
2mo i, 1:men. The jug and the cabin they proudly transformed into symbols of the
2mo i, 1:campaign, and won for their chieftain 234 electoral votes, while Van
2mo i, 1:Buren got only sixty.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Harrison and Tyler.=--The Hero of Tippecanoe was not long to enjoy the
2mo i, 1:fruits of his victory. The hungry horde of Whig office seekers descended
2mo i, 1:upon him like wolves upon the fold. If he went out they waylaid him; if
2mo i, 1:he stayed indoors, he was besieged; not even his bed chamber was spared.
2mo i, 1:He was none too strong at best and he took a deep cold on the day of his
2mo i, 1:inauguration. Between driving out Democrats and appeasing Whigs, he fell
2mo i, 1:mortally ill. Before the end of a month he lay dead at the capitol.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Harrison's successor, John Tyler, the Vice President, whom the Whigs had
2mo i, 1:nominated to catch votes in Virginia, was more of a Democrat than
2mo i, 1:anything else, though he was not partisan enough to please anybody. The
2mo i, 1:Whigs railed at him because he would not approve the founding of another
2mo i, 1:United States Bank. The Democrats stormed at him for refusing, until
2mo i, 1:near the end of his term, to sanction the annexation of Texas, which had
2mo i, 1:declared its independence of Mexico in 1836. His entire administration,
2mo i, 1:marked by unseemly wrangling, produced only two measures of importance.
2mo i, 1:The Whigs, flushed by victory, with the aid of a few protectionist
2mo i, 1:Democrats, enacted, in 1842, a new tariff law destroying the compromise
2mo i, 1:which had brought about the truce between the North and the South, in
2mo i, 1:the days of nullification. The distinguished leader of the Whigs, Daniel
2mo i, 1:Webster, as Secretary of State, in negotiation with Lord Ashburton
2mo i, 1:representing Great Britain, settled the long-standing dispute between
2mo i, 1:the two countries over the Maine boundary. A year after closing this
2mo i, 1:chapter in American diplomacy, Webster withdrew to private life, leaving
2mo i, 1:the President to endure alone the buffets of political fortune.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:To the end, the Whigs regarded Tyler as a traitor to their cause; but
2mo i, 1:the judgment of history is that it was a case of the biter bitten. They
2mo i, 1:had nominated him for the vice presidency as a man of views acceptable
2mo i, 1:to Southern Democrats in order to catch their votes, little reckoning
2mo i, 1:with the chances of his becoming President. Tyler had not deceived them
2mo i, 1:and, thoroughly soured, he left the White House in 1845 not to appear in
2mo i, 1:public life again until the days of secession, when he espoused the
2mo i, 1:Southern confederacy. Jacksonian Democracy, with new leadership, serving
2mo i, 1:a new cause--slavery--was returned to power under James K. Polk, a
2mo i, 1:friend of the General from Tennessee. A few grains of sand were to run
2mo i, 1:through the hour glass before the Whig party was to be broken and
2mo i, 1:scattered as the Federalists had been more than a generation before.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE INTERACTION OF AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN OPINION
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Democracy in England and France.=--During the period of Jacksonian
2mo i, 1:Democracy, as in all epochs of ferment, there was a close relation
2mo i, 1:between the thought of the New World and the Old. In England, the
2mo i, 1:successes of the American experiment were used as arguments in favor of
2mo i, 1:overthrowing the aristocracy which George III had manipulated with such
2mo i, 1:effect against America half a century before. In the United States, on
2mo i, 1:the other hand, conservatives like Chancellor Kent, the stout opponent
2mo i, 1:of manhood suffrage in New York, cited the riots of the British working
2mo i, 1:classes as a warning against admitting the same classes to a share in
2mo i, 1:the government of the United States. Along with the agitation of opinion
2mo i, 1:went epoch-making events. In 1832, the year of Jackson's second
2mo i, 1:triumph, the British Parliament passed its first reform bill, which
2mo i, 1:conferred the ballot--not on workingmen as yet--but on mill owners and
2mo i, 1:shopkeepers whom the landlords regarded with genuine horror. The initial
2mo i, 1:step was thus taken in breaking down the privileges of the landed
2mo i, 1:aristocracy and the rich merchants of England.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:About the same time a popular revolution occurred in France. The Bourbon
2mo i, 1:family, restored to the throne of France by the allied powers after
2mo i, 1:their victory over Napoleon in 1815, had embarked upon a policy of
2mo i, 1:arbitrary government. To use the familiar phrase, they had learned
2mo i, 1:nothing and forgotten nothing. Charles X, who came to the throne in
2mo i, 1:1824, set to work with zeal to undo the results of the French
2mo i, 1:Revolution, to stifle the press, restrict the suffrage, and restore the
2mo i, 1:clergy and the nobility to their ancient rights. His policy encountered
2mo i, 1:equally zealous opposition and in 1830 he was overthrown. The popular
2mo i, 1:party, under the leadership of Lafayette, established, not a republic as
2mo i, 1:some of the radicals had hoped, but a "liberal" middle-class monarchy
2mo i, 1:under Louis Philippe. This second French Revolution made a profound
2mo i, 1:impression on Americans, convincing them that the whole world was moving
2mo i, 1:toward democracy. The mayor, aldermen, and citizens of New York City
2mo i, 1:joined in a great parade to celebrate the fall of the Bourbons. Mingled
2mo i, 1:with cheers for the new order in France were hurrahs for "the people's
2mo i, 1:own, Andrew Jackson, the Hero of New Orleans and President of the United
2mo i, 1:States!"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=European Interest in America.=--To the older and more settled
2mo i, 1:Europeans, the democratic experiment in America was either a menace or
2mo i, 1:an inspiration. Conservatives viewed it with anxiety; liberals with
2mo i, 1:optimism. Far-sighted leaders could see that the tide of democracy was
2mo i, 1:rising all over the world and could not be stayed. Naturally the country
2mo i, 1:that had advanced furthest along the new course was the place in which
2mo i, 1:to find arguments for and against proposals that Europe should make
2mo i, 1:experiments of the same character.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=De Tocqueville's _Democracy in America_.=--In addition to the casual
2mo i, 1:traveler there began to visit the United States the thoughtful observer
2mo i, 1:bent on finding out what manner of nation this was springing up in the
2mo i, 1:wilderness. Those who looked with sympathy upon the growing popular
2mo i, 1:forces of England and France found in the United States, in spite of
2mo i, 1:many blemishes and defects, a guarantee for the future of the people's
2mo i, 1:rule in the Old World. One of these, Alexis de Tocqueville, a French
2mo i, 1:liberal of mildly democratic sympathies, made a journey to this country
2mo i, 1:in 1831; he described in a very remarkable volume, _Democracy in
2mo i, 1:America_, the grand experiment as he saw it. On the whole he was
2mo i, 1:convinced. After examining with a critical eye the life and labor of the
2mo i, 1:American people, as well as the constitutions of the states and the
2mo i, 1:nation, he came to the conclusion that democracy with all its faults was
2mo i, 1:both inevitable and successful. Slavery he thought was a painful
2mo i, 1:contrast to the other features of American life, and he foresaw what
2mo i, 1:proved to be the irrepressible conflict over it. He believed that
2mo i, 1:through blundering the people were destined to learn the highest of all
2mo i, 1:arts, self-government on a grand scale. The absence of a leisure class,
2mo i, 1:devoted to no calling or profession, merely enjoying the refinements of
2mo i, 1:life and adding to its graces--the flaw in American culture that gave
2mo i, 1:deep distress to many a European leader--de Tocqueville thought a
2mo i, 1:necessary virtue in the republic. "Amongst a democratic people where
2mo i, 1:there is no hereditary wealth, every man works to earn a living, or has
2mo i, 1:worked, or is born of parents who have worked. A notion of labor is
2mo i, 1:therefore presented to the mind on every side as the necessary, natural,
2mo i, 1:and honest condition of human existence." It was this notion of a
2mo i, 1:government in the hands of people who labored that struck the French
2mo i, 1:publicist as the most significant fact in the modern world.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Harriet Martineau's Visit to America.=--This phase of American life
2mo i, 1:also profoundly impressed the brilliant English writer, Harriet
2mo i, 1:Martineau. She saw all parts of the country, the homes of the rich and
2mo i, 1:the log cabins of the frontier; she traveled in stagecoaches, canal
2mo i, 1:boats, and on horseback; and visited sessions of Congress and auctions
2mo i, 1:at slave markets. She tried to view the country impartially and the
2mo i, 1:thing that left the deepest mark on her mind was the solidarity of the
2mo i, 1:people in one great political body. "However various may be the tribes
2mo i, 1:of inhabitants in those states, whatever part of the world may have been
2mo i, 1:their birthplace, or that of their fathers, however broken may be their
2mo i, 1:language, however servile or noble their employments, however exalted or
2mo i, 1:despised their state, all are declared to be bound together by equal
2mo i, 1:political obligations.... In that self-governing country all are held to
2mo i, 1:have an equal interest in the principles of its institutions and to be
2mo i, 1:bound in equal duty to watch their workings." Miss Martineau was also
2mo i, 1:impressed with the passion of Americans for land ownership and
2mo i, 1:contrasted the United States favorably with England where the tillers of
2mo i, 1:the soil were either tenants or laborers for wages.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Adverse Criticism.=--By no means all observers and writers were
2mo i, 1:convinced that America was a success. The fastidious traveler, Mrs.
2mo i, 1:Trollope, who thought the English system of church and state was ideal,
2mo i, 1:saw in the United States only roughness and ignorance. She lamented the
2mo i, 1:"total and universal want of manners both in males and females," adding
2mo i, 1:that while "they appear to have clear heads and active intellects,"
2mo i, 1:there was "no charm, no grace in their conversation." She found
2mo i, 1:everywhere a lack of reverence for kings, learning, and rank. Other
2mo i, 1:critics were even more savage. The editor of the _Foreign Quarterly_
2mo i, 1:petulantly exclaimed that the United States was "a brigand
2mo i, 1:confederation." Charles Dickens declared the country to be "so maimed
2mo i, 1:and lame, so full of sores and ulcers that her best friends turn from
2mo i, 1:the loathsome creature in disgust." Sydney Smith, editor of the
2mo i, 1:_Edinburgh Review_, was never tired of trying his caustic wit at the
2mo i, 1:expense of America. "Their Franklins and Washingtons and all the other
2mo i, 1:sages and heroes of their revolution were born and bred subjects of the
2mo i, 1:king of England," he observed in 1820. "During the thirty or forty
2mo i, 1:years of their independence they have done absolutely nothing for the
2mo i, 1:sciences, for the arts, for literature, or even for the statesmanlike
2mo i, 1:studies of politics or political economy.... In the four quarters of the
2mo i, 1:globe who reads an American book? Or goes to an American play? Or looks
2mo i, 1:at an American picture or statue?" To put a sharp sting into his taunt
2mo i, 1:he added, forgetting by whose authority slavery was introduced and
2mo i, 1:fostered: "Under which of the old tyrannical governments of Europe is
2mo i, 1:every sixth man a slave whom his fellow creatures may buy and sell?"
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Some Americans, while resenting the hasty and often superficial
2mo i, 1:judgments of European writers, winced under their satire and took
2mo i, 1:thought about certain particulars in the indictments brought against
2mo i, 1:them. The mass of the people, however, bent on the great experiment,
2mo i, 1:gave little heed to carping critics who saw the flaws and not the
2mo i, 1:achievements of our country--critics who were in fact less interested in
2mo i, 1:America than in preventing the rise and growth of democracy in Europe.

2mo i, 1:CHAPTER XII
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE MIDDLE BORDER AND THE GREAT WEST
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:"We shall not send an emigrant beyond the Mississippi in a hundred
2mo i, 1:years," exclaimed Livingston, the principal author of the Louisiana
2mo i, 1:purchase. When he made this astounding declaration, he doubtless had
2mo i, 1:before his mind's eye the great stretches of unoccupied lands between
2mo i, 1:the Appalachians and the Mississippi. He also had before him the history
2mo i, 1:of the English colonies, which told him of the two centuries required to
2mo i, 1:settle the seaboard region. To practical men, his prophecy did not seem
2mo i, 1:far wrong; but before the lapse of half that time there appeared beyond
2mo i, 1:the Mississippi a tier of new states, reaching from the Gulf of Mexico
2mo i, 1:to the southern boundary of Minnesota, and a new commonwealth on the
2mo i, 1:Pacific Ocean where American emigrants had raised the Bear flag of
2mo i, 1:California.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE ADVANCE OF THE MIDDLE BORDER
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Missouri.=--When the middle of the nineteenth century had been reached,
2mo i, 1:the Mississippi River, which Daniel Boone, the intrepid hunter, had
2mo i, 1:crossed during Washington's administration "to escape from civilization"
2mo i, 1:in Kentucky, had become the waterway for a vast empire. The center of
2mo i, 1:population of the United States had passed to the Ohio Valley. Missouri,
2mo i, 1:with its wide reaches of rich lands, low-lying, level, and fertile, well
2mo i, 1:adapted to hemp raising, had drawn to its borders thousands of planters
2mo i, 1:from the old Southern states--from Virginia and the Carolinas as well as
2mo i, 1:from Kentucky and Tennessee. When the great compromise of 1820-21
2mo i, 1:admitted her to the union, wearing "every jewel of sovereignty," as a
2mo i, 1:florid orator announced, migratory slave owners were assured that their
2mo i, 1:property would be safe in Missouri. Along the western shore of the
2mo i, 1:Mississippi and on both banks of the Missouri to the uttermost limits of
2mo i, 1:the state, plantations tilled by bondmen spread out in broad expanses.
2mo i, 1:In the neighborhood of Jefferson City the slaves numbered more than a
2mo i, 1:fourth of the population.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Into this stream of migration from the planting South flowed another
2mo i, 1:current of land-tilling farmers; some from Kentucky, Tennessee, and
2mo i, 1:Mississippi, driven out by the onrush of the planters buying and
2mo i, 1:consolidating small farms into vast estates; and still more from the
2mo i, 1:East and the Old World. To the northwest over against Iowa and to the
2mo i, 1:southwest against Arkansas, these yeomen laid out farms to be tilled by
2mo i, 1:their own labor. In those regions the number of slaves seldom rose above
2mo i, 1:five or six per cent of the population. The old French post, St. Louis,
2mo i, 1:enriched by the fur trade of the Far West and the steamboat traffic of
2mo i, 1:the river, grew into a thriving commercial city, including among its
2mo i, 1:seventy-five thousand inhabitants in 1850 nearly forty thousand
2mo i, 1:foreigners, German immigrants from Pennsylvania and Europe being the
2mo i, 1:largest single element.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Arkansas.=--Below Missouri lay the territory of Arkansas, which had
2mo i, 1:long been the paradise of the swarthy hunter and the restless
2mo i, 1:frontiersman fleeing from the advancing borders of farm and town. In
2mo i, 1:search of the life, wild and free, where the rifle supplied the game and
2mo i, 1:a few acres of ground the corn and potatoes, they had filtered into the
2mo i, 1:territory in an unending drift, "squatting" on the land. Without so much
2mo i, 1:as asking the leave of any government, territorial or national, they
2mo i, 1:claimed as their own the soil on which they first planted their feet.
2mo i, 1:Like the Cherokee Indians, whom they had as neighbors, whose very
2mo i, 1:customs and dress they sometimes adopted, the squatters spent their days
2mo i, 1:in the midst of rough plenty, beset by chills, fevers, and the ills of
2mo i, 1:the flesh, but for many years unvexed by political troubles or the
2mo i, 1:restrictions of civilized life.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Unfortunately for them, however, the fertile valleys of the Mississippi
2mo i, 1:and Arkansas were well adapted to the cultivation of cotton and tobacco
2mo i, 1:and their sylvan peace was soon broken by an invasion of planters. The
2mo i, 1:newcomers, with their servile workers, spread upward in the valley
2mo i, 1:toward Missouri and along the southern border westward to the Red River.
2mo i, 1:In time the slaves in the tier of counties against Louisiana ranged from
2mo i, 1:thirty to seventy per cent of the population. This marked the doom of
2mo i, 1:the small farmer, swept Arkansas into the main current of planting
2mo i, 1:politics, and led to a powerful lobby at Washington in favor of
2mo i, 1:admission to the union, a boon granted in 1836.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Michigan.=--In accordance with a well-established custom, a free state
2mo i, 1:was admitted to the union to balance a slave state. In 1833, the people
2mo i, 1:of Michigan, a territory ten times the size of Connecticut, announced
2mo i, 1:that the time had come for them to enjoy the privileges of a
2mo i, 1:commonwealth. All along the southern border the land had been occupied
2mo i, 1:largely by pioneers from New England, who built prim farmhouses and
2mo i, 1:adopted the town-meeting plan of self-government after the fashion of
2mo i, 1:the old home. The famous post of Detroit was growing into a flourishing
2mo i, 1:city as the boats plying on the Great Lakes carried travelers, settlers,
2mo i, 1:and freight through the narrows. In all, according to the census, there
2mo i, 1:were more than ninety thousand inhabitants in the territory; so it was
2mo i, 1:not without warrant that they clamored for statehood. Congress, busy as
2mo i, 1:ever with politics, delayed; and the inhabitants of Michigan, unable to
2mo i, 1:restrain their impatience, called a convention, drew up a constitution,
2mo i, 1:and started a lively quarrel with Ohio over the southern boundary. The
2mo i, 1:hand of Congress was now forced. Objections were made to the new
2mo i, 1:constitution on the ground that it gave the ballot to all free white
2mo i, 1:males, including aliens not yet naturalized; but the protests were
2mo i, 1:overborne in a long debate. The boundary was fixed, and Michigan, though
2mo i, 1:shorn of some of the land she claimed, came into the union in 1837.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Wisconsin.=--Across Lake Michigan to the west lay the territory of
2mo i, 1:Wisconsin, which shared with Michigan the interesting history of the
2mo i, 1:Northwest, running back into the heroic days when French hunters and
2mo i, 1:missionaries were planning a French empire for the great monarch, Louis
2mo i, 1:XIV. It will not be forgotten that the French rangers of the woods, the
2mo i, 1:black-robed priests, prepared for sacrifice, even to death, the trappers
2mo i, 1:of the French agencies, and the French explorers--Marquette, Joliet, and
2mo i, 1:Menard--were the first white men to paddle their frail barks through the
2mo i, 1:northern waters. They first blazed their trails into the black forests
2mo i, 1:and left traces of their work in the names of portages and little
2mo i, 1:villages. It was from these forests that Red Men in full war paint
2mo i, 1:journeyed far to fight under the _fleur-de-lis_ of France when the
2mo i, 1:soldiers of King Louis made their last stand at Quebec and Montreal
2mo i, 1:against the imperial arms of Britain. It was here that the British flag
2mo i, 1:was planted in 1761 and that the great Pontiac conspiracy was formed two
2mo i, 1:years later to overthrow British dominion.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:When, a generation afterward, the Stars and Stripes supplanted the Union
2mo i, 1:Jack, the French were still almost the only white men in the region.
2mo i, 1:They were soon joined by hustling Yankee fur traders who did battle
2mo i, 1:royal against British interlopers. The traders cut their way through
2mo i, 1:forest trails and laid out the routes through lake and stream and over
2mo i, 1:portages for the settlers and their families from the states "back
2mo i, 1:East." It was the forest ranger who discovered the water power later
2mo i, 1:used to turn the busy mills grinding the grain from the spreading farm
2mo i, 1:lands. In the wake of the fur hunters, forest men, and farmers came
2mo i, 1:miners from Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri crowding in to exploit the
2mo i, 1:lead ores of the northwest, some of them bringing slaves to work their
2mo i, 1:claims. Had it not been for the gold fever of 1849 that drew the
2mo i, 1:wielders of pick and shovel to the Far West, Wisconsin would early have
2mo i, 1:taken high rank among the mining regions of the country.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:From a favorable point of vantage on Lake Michigan, the village of
2mo i, 1:Milwaukee, a center for lumber and grain transport and a place of entry
2mo i, 1:for Eastern goods, grew into a thriving city. It claimed twenty thousand
2mo i, 1:inhabitants, when in 1848 Congress admitted Wisconsin to the union.
2mo i, 1:Already the Germans, Irish, and Scandinavians had found their way into
2mo i, 1:the territory. They joined Americans from the older states in clearing
2mo i, 1:forests, building roads, transforming trails into highways, erecting
2mo i, 1:mills, and connecting streams with canals to make a network of routes
2mo i, 1:for the traffic that poured to and from the Great Lakes.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Iowa and Minnesota.=--To the southwest of Wisconsin beyond the
2mo i, 1:Mississippi, where the tall grass of the prairies waved like the sea,
2mo i, 1:farmers from New England, New York, and Ohio had prepared Iowa for
2mo i, 1:statehood. A tide of immigration that might have flowed into Missouri
2mo i, 1:went northward; for freemen, unaccustomed to slavery and slave markets,
2mo i, 1:preferred the open country above the compromise line. With incredible
2mo i, 1:swiftness, they spread farms westward from the Mississippi. With Yankee
2mo i, 1:ingenuity they turned to trading on the river, building before 1836
2mo i, 1:three prosperous centers of traffic: Dubuque, Davenport, and Burlington.
2mo i, 1:True to their old traditions, they founded colleges and academies that
2mo i, 1:religion and learning might be cherished on the frontier as in the
2mo i, 1:states from which they came. Prepared for self-government, the Iowans
2mo i, 1:laid siege to the door of Congress and were admitted to the union in
2mo i, 1:1846.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Above Iowa, on the Mississippi, lay the territory of Minnesota--the home
2mo i, 1:of the Dakotas, the Ojibways, and the Sioux. Like Michigan and
2mo i, 1:Wisconsin, it had been explored early by the French scouts, and the
2mo i, 1:first white settlement was the little French village of Mendota. To the
2mo i, 1:people of the United States, the resources of the country were first
2mo i, 1:revealed by the historic journey of Zebulon Pike in 1805 and by American
2mo i, 1:fur traders who were quick to take advantage of the opportunity to ply
2mo i, 1:their arts of hunting and bartering in fresh fields. In 1839 an
2mo i, 1:American settlement was planted at Marina on the St. Croix, the outpost
2mo i, 1:of advancing civilization. Within twenty years, the territory, boasting
2mo i, 1:a population of 150,000, asked for admission to the union. In 1858 the
2mo i, 1:plea was granted and Minnesota showed her gratitude three years later by
2mo i, 1:being first among the states to offer troops to Lincoln in the hour of
2mo i, 1:peril.

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Uniformity of the Middle West.=--There was a certain monotony about
2mo i, 1:pioneering in the Northwest and on the middle border. As the long
2mo i, 1:stretches of land were cleared or prepared for the plow, they were laid
2mo i, 1:out like checkerboards into squares of forty, eighty, one hundred sixty,
2mo i, 1:or more acres, each the seat of a homestead. There was a striking
2mo i, 1:uniformity also about the endless succession of fertile fields spreading
2mo i, 1:far and wide under the hot summer sun. No majestic mountains relieved
2mo i, 1:the sweep of the prairie. Few monuments of other races and antiquity
2mo i, 1:were there to awaken curiosity about the region. No sonorous bells in
2mo i, 1:old missions rang out the time of day. The chaffering Red Man bartering
2mo i, 1:blankets and furs for powder and whisky had passed farther on. The
2mo i, 1:population was made up of plain farmers and their families engaged in
2mo i, 1:severe and unbroken labor, chopping down trees, draining fever-breeding
2mo i, 1:swamps, breaking new ground, and planting from year to year the same
2mo i, 1:rotation of crops. Nearly all the settlers were of native American stock
2mo i, 1:into whose frugal and industrious lives the later Irish and German
2mo i, 1:immigrants fitted, on the whole, with little friction. Even the Dutch
2mo i, 1:oven fell before the cast-iron cooking stove. Happiness and sorrow,
2mo i, 1:despair and hope were there, but all encompassed by the heavy tedium of
2mo i, 1:prosaic sameness.

2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=A Contrast in the Far West and Southwest.=--As George Rogers Clark and
2mo i, 1:Daniel Boone had stirred the snug Americans of the seaboard to seek
2mo i, 1:their fortunes beyond the Appalachians, so now Kit Carson, James Bowie,
2mo i, 1:Sam Houston, Davy Crockett, and John C. Fremont were to lead the way
2mo i, 1:into a new land, only a part of which was under the American flag. The
2mo i, 1:setting for this new scene in the westward movement was thrown out in a
2mo i, 1:wide sweep from the headwaters of the Mississippi to the banks of the
2mo i, 1:Rio Grande; from the valleys of the Sabine and Red rivers to Montana and
2mo i, 1:the Pacific slope. In comparison with the middle border, this region
2mo i, 1:presented such startling diversities that only the eye of faith could
2mo i, 1:foresee the unifying power of nationalism binding its communities with
2mo i, 1:the older sections of the country. What contrasts indeed! The blue grass
2mo i, 1:region of Kentucky or the rich, black soil of Illinois--the painted
2mo i, 1:desert, the home of the sage brush and the coyote! The level prairies of
2mo i, 1:Iowa--the mighty Rockies shouldering themselves high against the
2mo i, 1:horizon! The long bleak winters of Wisconsin--California of endless
2mo i, 1:summer! The log churches of Indiana or Illinois--the quaint missions of
2mo i, 1:San Antonio, Tucson, and Santa Barbara! The little state of
2mo i, 1:Delaware--the empire of Texas, one hundred and twenty times its area!
2mo i, 1:And scattered about through the Southwest were signs of an ancient
2mo i, 1:civilization--fragments of four-and five-story dwellings, ruined dams,
2mo i, 1:aqueducts, and broken canals, which told of once prosperous peoples
2mo i, 1:who, by art and science, had conquered the aridity of the desert and
2mo i, 1:lifted themselves in the scale of culture above the savages of the
2mo i, 1:plain.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The settlers of this vast empire were to be as diverse in their origins
2mo i, 1:and habits as those of the colonies on the coast had been. Americans of
2mo i, 1:English, Irish, and Scotch-Irish descent came as usual from the Eastern
2mo i, 1:states. To them were added the migratory Germans as well. Now for the
2mo i, 1:first time came throngs of Scandinavians. Some were to make their homes
2mo i, 1:on quiet farms as the border advanced against the setting sun. Others
2mo i, 1:were to be Indian scouts, trappers, fur hunters, miners, cowboys, Texas
2mo i, 1:planters, keepers of lonely posts on the plain and the desert, stage
2mo i, 1:drivers, pilots of wagon trains, pony riders, fruit growers, "lumber
2mo i, 1:jacks," and smelter workers. One common bond united them--a passion for
2mo i, 1:the self-government accorded to states. As soon as a few thousand
2mo i, 1:settlers came together in a single territory, there arose a mighty shout
2mo i, 1:for a position beside the staid commonwealths of the East and the South.
2mo i, 1:Statehood meant to the pioneers self-government, dignity, and the right
2mo i, 1:to dispose of land, minerals, and timber in their own way. In the quest
2mo i, 1:for this local autonomy there arose many a wordy contest in Congress,
2mo i, 1:each of the political parties lending a helping hand in the admission of
2mo i, 1:a state when it gave promise of adding new congressmen of the "right
2mo i, 1:political persuasion," to use the current phrase.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Southern Planters and Texas.=--While the farmers of the North found the
2mo i, 1:broad acres of the Western prairies stretching on before them apparently
2mo i, 1:in endless expanse, it was far different with the Southern planters.
2mo i, 1:Ever active in their search for new fields as they exhausted the virgin
2mo i, 1:soil of the older states, the restless subjects of King Cotton quickly
2mo i, 1:reached the frontier of Louisiana. There they paused; but only for a
2mo i, 1:moment. The fertile land of Texas just across the boundary lured them on
2mo i, 1:and the Mexican republic to which it belonged extended to them a more
2mo i, 1:than generous welcome. Little realizing the perils lurking in a
2mo i, 1:"peaceful penetration," the authorities at Mexico City opened wide the
2mo i, 1:doors and made large grants of land to American contractors, who agreed
2mo i, 1:to bring a number of families into Texas. The omnipresent Yankee, in the
2mo i, 1:person of Moses Austin of Connecticut, hearing of this good news in the
2mo i, 1:Southwest, obtained a grant in 1820 to settle three hundred Americans
2mo i, 1:near Bexar--a commission finally carried out to the letter by his son
2mo i, 1:and celebrated in the name given to the present capital of the state of
2mo i, 1:Texas. Within a decade some twenty thousand Americans had crossed the
2mo i, 1:border.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Mexico Closes the Door.=--The government of Mexico, unaccustomed to
2mo i, 1:such enterprise and thoroughly frightened by its extent, drew back in
2mo i, 1:dismay. Its fears were increased as quarrels broke out between the
2mo i, 1:Americans and the natives in Texas. Fear grew into consternation when
2mo i, 1:efforts were made by President Jackson to buy the territory for the
2mo i, 1:United States. Mexico then sought to close the flood gates. It stopped
2mo i, 1:all American colonization schemes, canceled many of the land grants, put
2mo i, 1:a tariff on farming implements, and abolished slavery. These barriers
2mo i, 1:were raised too late. A call for help ran through the western border of
2mo i, 1:the United States. The sentinels of the frontier answered. Davy
2mo i, 1:Crockett, the noted frontiersman, bear hunter, and backwoods politician;
2mo i, 1:James Bowie, the dexterous wielder of the knife that to this day bears
2mo i, 1:his name; and Sam Houston, warrior and pioneer, rushed to the aid of
2mo i, 1:their countrymen in Texas. Unacquainted with the niceties of diplomacy,
2mo i, 1:impatient at the formalities of international law, they soon made it
2mo i, 1:known that in spite of Mexican sovereignty they would be their own
2mo i, 1:masters.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Independence of Texas Declared.=--Numbering only about one-fourth
2mo i, 1:of the population in Texas, they raised the standard of revolt in 1836
2mo i, 1:and summoned a convention. Following in the footsteps of their
2mo i, 1:ancestors, they issued a declaration of independence signed mainly by
2mo i, 1:Americans from the slave states. Anticipating that the government of
2mo i, 1:Mexico would not quietly accept their word of defiance as final, they
2mo i, 1:dispatched a force to repel "the invading army," as General Houston
2mo i, 1:called the troops advancing under the command of Santa Ana, the Mexican
2mo i, 1:president. A portion of the Texan soldiers took their stand in the
2mo i, 1:Alamo, an old Spanish mission in the cottonwood trees in the town of San
2mo i, 1:Antonio. Instead of obeying the order to blow up the mission and retire,
2mo i, 1:they held their ground until they were completely surrounded and cut off
2mo i, 1:from all help. Refusing to surrender, they fought to the bitter end, the
2mo i, 1:last man falling a victim to the sword. Vengeance was swift. Within
2mo i, 1:three months General Houston overwhelmed Santa Ana at the San Jacinto,
2mo i, 1:taking him prisoner of war and putting an end to all hopes for the
2mo i, 1:restoration of Mexican sovereignty over Texas.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:The Lone Star Republic, with Houston at the head, then sought admission
2mo i, 1:to the United States. This seemed at first an easy matter. All that was
2mo i, 1:required to bring it about appeared to be a treaty annexing Texas to the
2mo i, 1:union. Moreover, President Jackson, at the height of his popularity, had
2mo i, 1:a warm regard for General Houston and, with his usual sympathy for rough
2mo i, 1:and ready ways of doing things, approved the transaction. Through an
2mo i, 1:American representative in Mexico, Jackson had long and anxiously
2mo i, 1:labored, by means none too nice, to wring from the Mexican republic the
2mo i, 1:cession of the coveted territory. When the Texans took matters into
2mo i, 1:their own hands, he was more than pleased; but he could not marshal the
2mo i, 1:approval of two-thirds of the Senators required for a treaty of
2mo i, 1:annexation. Cautious as well as impetuous, Jackson did not press the
2mo i, 1:issue; he went out of office in 1837 with Texas uncertain as to her
2mo i, 1:future.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Northern Opposition to Annexation.=--All through the North the
2mo i, 1:opposition to annexation was clear and strong. Anti-slavery agitators
2mo i, 1:could hardly find words savage enough to express their feelings.
2mo i, 1:"Texas," exclaimed Channing in a letter to Clay, "is but the first step
2mo i, 1:of aggression. I trust indeed that Providence will beat back and humble
2mo i, 1:our cupidity and ambition. I now ask whether as a people we are
2mo i, 1:prepared to seize on a neighboring territory for the end of extending
2mo i, 1:slavery? I ask whether as a people we can stand forth in the sight of
2mo i, 1:God, in the sight of nations, and adopt this atrocious policy? Sooner
2mo i, 1:perish! Sooner be our name blotted out from the record of nations!"
2mo i, 1:William Lloyd Garrison called for the secession of the Northern states
2mo i, 1:if Texas was brought into the union with slavery. John Quincy Adams
2mo i, 1:warned his countrymen that they were treading in the path of the
2mo i, 1:imperialism that had brought the nations of antiquity to judgment and
2mo i, 1:destruction. Henry Clay, the Whig candidate for President, taking into
2mo i, 1:account changing public sentiment, blew hot and cold, losing the state
2mo i, 1:of New York and the election of 1844 by giving a qualified approval of
2mo i, 1:annexation. In the same campaign, the Democrats boldly demanded the
2mo i, 1:"Reannexation of Texas," based on claims which the United States once
2mo i, 1:had to Spanish territory beyond the Sabine River.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Annexation.=--The politicians were disposed to walk very warily. Van
2mo i, 1:Buren, at heart opposed to slavery extension, refused to press the issue
2mo i, 1:of annexation. Tyler, a pro-slavery Democrat from Virginia, by a strange
2mo i, 1:fling of fortune carried into office as a nominal Whig, kept his mind
2mo i, 1:firmly fixed on the idea of reelection and let the troublesome matter
2mo i, 1:rest until the end of his administration was in sight. He then listened
2mo i, 1:with favor to the voice of the South. Calhoun stated what seemed to be a
2mo i, 1:convincing argument: All good Americans have their hearts set on the
2mo i, 1:Constitution; the admission of Texas is absolutely essential to the
2mo i, 1:preservation of the union; it will give a balance of power to the South
2mo i, 1:as against the North growing with incredible swiftness in wealth and
2mo i, 1:population. Tyler, impressed by the plea, appointed Calhoun to the
2mo i, 1:office of Secretary of State in 1844, authorizing him to negotiate the
2mo i, 1:treaty of annexation--a commission at once executed. This scheme was
2mo i, 1:blocked in the Senate where the necessary two-thirds vote could not be
2mo i, 1:secured. Balked but not defeated, the advocates of annexation drew up a
2mo i, 1:joint resolution which required only a majority vote in both houses,
2mo i, 1:and in February of the next year, just before Tyler gave way to Polk,
2mo i, 1:they pushed it through Congress. So Texas, amid the groans of Boston and
2mo i, 1:the hurrahs of Charleston, folded up her flag and came into the union.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:[Illustration: TEXAS AND THE TERRITORY IN DISPUTE]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Mexican War.=--The inevitable war with Mexico, foretold by the
2mo i, 1:abolitionists and feared by Henry Clay, ensued, the ostensible cause
2mo i, 1:being a dispute over the boundaries of the new state. The Texans claimed
2mo i, 1:all the lands down to the Rio Grande. The Mexicans placed the border of
2mo i, 1:Texas at the Nueces River and a line drawn thence in a northerly
2mo i, 1:direction. President Polk, accepting the Texan view of the controversy,
2mo i, 1:ordered General Zachary Taylor to move beyond the Nueces in defense of
2mo i, 1:American sovereignty. This act of power, deemed by the Mexicans an
2mo i, 1:invasion of their territory, was followed by an attack on our troops.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:President Polk, not displeased with the turn of events, announced that
2mo i, 1:American blood had been "spilled on American soil" and that war existed
2mo i, 1:"by the act of Mexico." Congress, in a burst of patriotic fervor,
2mo i, 1:brushed aside the protests of those who deplored the conduct of the
2mo i, 1:government as wanton aggression on a weaker nation and granted money and
2mo i, 1:supplies to prosecute the war. The few Whigs in the House of
2mo i, 1:Representatives, who refused to vote in favor of taking up arms,
2mo i, 1:accepted the inevitable with such good grace as they could command. All
2mo i, 1:through the South and the West the war was popular. New England
2mo i, 1:grumbled, but gave loyal, if not enthusiastic, support to a conflict
2mo i, 1:precipitated by policies not of its own choosing. Only a handful of firm
2mo i, 1:objectors held out. James Russell Lowell, in his _Biglow Papers_, flung
2mo i, 1:scorn and sarcasm to the bitter end.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=The Outcome of the War.=--The foregone conclusion was soon reached.
2mo i, 1:General Taylor might have delivered the fatal thrust from northern
2mo i, 1:Mexico if politics had not intervened. Polk, anxious to avoid raising up
2mo i, 1:another military hero for the Whigs to nominate for President, decided
2mo i, 1:to divide the honors by sending General Scott to strike a blow at the
2mo i, 1:capital, Mexico City. The deed was done with speed and pomp and two
2mo i, 1:heroes were lifted into presidential possibilities. In the Far West a
2mo i, 1:third candidate was made, John C. Fremont, who, in cooperation with
2mo i, 1:Commodores Sloat and Stockton and General Kearney, planted the Stars and
2mo i, 1:Stripes on the Pacific slope.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:In February, 1848, the Mexicans came to terms, ceding to the victor
2mo i, 1:California, Arizona, New Mexico, and more--a domain greater in extent
2mo i, 1:than the combined areas of France and Germany. As a salve to the wound,
2mo i, 1:the vanquished received fifteen million dollars in cash and the
2mo i, 1:cancellation of many claims held by American citizens. Five years later,
2mo i, 1:through the negotiations of James Gadsden, a further cession of lands
2mo i, 1:along the southern border of Arizona and New Mexico was secured on
2mo i, 1:payment of ten million dollars.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=General Taylor Elected President.=--The ink was hardly dry upon the
2mo i, 1:treaty that closed the war before "rough and ready" General Taylor, a
2mo i, 1:slave owner from Louisiana, "a Whig," as he said, "but not an ultra
2mo i, 1:Whig," was put forward as the Whig candidate for President. He himself
2mo i, 1:had not voted for years and he was fairly innocent in matters political.
2mo i, 1:The tariff, the currency, and internal improvements, with a magnificent
2mo i, 1:gesture he referred to the people's representatives in Congress,
2mo i, 1:offering to enforce the laws as made, if elected. Clay's followers
2mo i, 1:mourned. Polk stormed but could not win even a renomination at the hands
2mo i, 1:of the Democrats. So it came about that the hero of Buena Vista,
2mo i, 1:celebrated for his laconic order, "Give 'em a little more grape, Captain
2mo i, 1:Bragg," became President of the United States.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:THE PACIFIC COAST AND UTAH
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=Oregon.=--Closely associated in the popular mind with the contest about
2mo i, 1:the affairs of Texas was a dispute with Great Britain over the
2mo i, 1:possession of territory in Oregon. In their presidential campaign of
2mo i, 1:1844, the Democrats had coupled with the slogan, "The Reannexation of
2mo i, 1:Texas," two other cries, "The Reoccupation of Oregon," and "Fifty-four
2mo i, 1:Forty or Fight." The last two slogans were founded on American
2mo i, 1:discoveries and explorations in the Far Northwest. Their appearance in
2mo i, 1:politics showed that the distant Oregon country, larger in area than New
2mo i, 1:England, New York, and Pennsylvania combined, was at last receiving from
2mo i, 1:the nation the attention which its importance warranted.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_Joint Occupation and Settlement._--Both England and the United States
2mo i, 1:had long laid claim to Oregon and in 1818 they had agreed to occupy the
2mo i, 1:territory jointly--a contract which was renewed ten years later for an
2mo i, 1:indefinite period. Under this plan, citizens of both countries were free
2mo i, 1:to hunt and settle anywhere in the region. The vanguard of British fur
2mo i, 1:traders and Canadian priests was enlarged by many new recruits, with
2mo i, 1:Americans not far behind them. John Jacob Astor, the resourceful New
2mo i, 1:York merchant, sent out trappers and hunters who established a trading
2mo i, 1:post at Astoria in 1811. Some twenty years later, American
2mo i, 1:missionaries--among them two very remarkable men, Jason Lee and Marcus
2mo i, 1:Whitman--were preaching the gospel to the Indians.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Through news from the fur traders and missionaries, Eastern farmers
2mo i, 1:heard of the fertile lands awaiting their plows on the Pacific slope;
2mo i, 1:those with the pioneering spirit made ready to take possession of the
2mo i, 1:new country. In 1839 a band went around by Cape Horn. Four years later a
2mo i, 1:great expedition went overland. The way once broken, others followed
2mo i, 1:rapidly. As soon as a few settlements were well established, the
2mo i, 1:pioneers held a mass meeting and agreed upon a plan of government. "We,
2mo i, 1:the people of Oregon territory," runs the preamble to their compact,
2mo i, 1:"for the purposes of mutual protection and to secure peace and
2mo i, 1:prosperity among ourselves, agree to adopt the following laws and
2mo i, 1:regulations until such time as the United States of America extend their
2mo i, 1:jurisdiction over us." Thus self-government made its way across the
2mo i, 1:Rocky Mountains.

2mo i, 1:[Illustration: THE OREGON COUNTRY AND THE DISPUTED BOUNDARY]
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_The Boundary Dispute with England Adjusted._--By this time it was
2mo i, 1:evident that the boundaries of Oregon must be fixed. Having made the
2mo i, 1:question an issue in his campaign, Polk, after his election in 1844,
2mo i, 1:pressed it upon the attention of the country. In his inaugural address
2mo i, 1:and his first message to Congress he reiterated the claim of the
2mo i, 1:Democratic platform that "our title to the whole territory of Oregon is
2mo i, 1:clear and unquestionable." This pretension Great Britain firmly
2mo i, 1:rejected, leaving the President a choice between war and compromise.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:Polk, already having the contest with Mexico on his hands, sought and
2mo i, 1:obtained a compromise. The British government, moved by a hint from the
2mo i, 1:American minister, offered a settlement which would fix the boundary at
2mo i, 1:the forty-ninth parallel instead of "fifty-four forty," and give it
2mo i, 1:Vancouver Island. Polk speedily chose this way out of the dilemma.
2mo i, 1:Instead of making the decision himself, however, and drawing up a
2mo i, 1:treaty, he turned to the Senate for "counsel." As prearranged with party
2mo i, 1:leaders, the advice was favorable to the plan. The treaty, duly drawn in
2mo i, 1:1846, was ratified by the Senate after an acrimonious debate. "Oh!
2mo i, 1:mountain that was delivered of a mouse," exclaimed Senator Benton, "thy
2mo i, 1:name shall be fifty-four forty!" Thirteen years later, the southern part
2mo i, 1:of the territory was admitted to the union as the state of Oregon,
2mo i, 1:leaving the northern and eastern sections in the status of a territory.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:=California.=--With the growth of the northwestern empire, dedicated by
2mo i, 1:nature to freedom, the planting interests might have been content, had
2mo i, 1:fortune not wrested from them the fair country of California. Upon this
2mo i, 1:huge territory they had set their hearts. The mild climate and fertile
2mo i, 1:soil seemed well suited to slavery and the planters expected to extend
2mo i, 1:their sway to the entire domain. California was a state of more than
2mo i, 1:155,000 square miles--about seventy times the size of the state of
2mo i, 1:Delaware. It could readily be divided into five or six large states, if
2mo i, 1:that became necessary to preserve the Southern balance of power.
2mo i, 1:
2mo i, 1:_Early American Relations with California._--Time and tide, it seems,
2mo i, 1:were not on the side of the planters. Already Americans of a far
2mo i, 1:different type were invading the Pacific slope. Long before Polk ever
2mo i, 1:dreamed of California, the Yankee with his cargo of notions had been
2mo i, 1:around the Horn. Daring skippers had sailed out of New England harbors
2mo i, 1:with a variety of goods, bent their course around South America to
2mo i, 1:California, on to China and around the world, trading as they went and
2mo i, 1:leaving pots, pans, woolen cloth, guns, boots, shoes, salt fish, naval
2mo i, 1:stores, and rum in their wake. "Home from Californy!" rang the cry in
2mo i, 1:many a New England port as a good captain let go his anchor on his
2mo i, 1:return from the long trading voyage in the Pacific.
